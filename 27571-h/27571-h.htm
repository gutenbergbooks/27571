<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>In preparing the present volume, the writer has been actuated
by a conscientious desire to deepen and vivify our
faith in the Christian system of truth, by showing that it does
not rest <i>solely</i> on a special class of facts, but upon all the facts
of nature and humanity; that its authority does not repose
<i>alone</i> on the peculiar and supernatural events which transpired
in Palestine, but also on the still broader foundations of the
ideas and laws of the reason, and the common wants and instinctive
yearnings of the human heart. It is his conviction
that the course and constitution of nature, the whole current
of history, and the entire development of human thought in
the ages anterior to the advent of the Redeemer centre in, and
can only be interpreted by, the purpose of redemption.</p>

<p>The method hitherto most prevalent, of treating the history
of human thought as a series of isolated, disconnected, and
lawless movements, without unity and purpose; and the practice
of denouncing the religions and philosophies of the ancient
world as inventions of satanic mischief, or as the capricious
and wicked efforts of humanity to relegate itself from the bonds
of allegiance to the One Supreme Lord and Lawgiver, have, in
his judgment, been prejudicial to the interests of all truth, and
especially injurious to the cause of Christianity. They betray
an utter insensibility to the grand unities of nature and of
thought, and a strange forgetfulness of that universal Providence
which comprehends all nature and all history, and is
yet so minute in its regards that it numbers the hairs on every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="vi" id="vi">vi</a></span>
human head, and takes note of every sparrow's fall, A juster
method will lead us to regard the entire history of human
thought as a development towards a specific end, and the providence
of God as an all-embracing plan, which sweeps over all
ages and all nations, and which, in its final consummation, will,
through Christ, "gather together all things in one, both things
which are in heaven and things which are on earth."</p>

<p>The central and unifying thought of this volume is <i>that the
necessary ideas and laws of the reason, and the native instincts
of the human heart, originally implanted by God, are the primal
and germinal forces of history; and that these have been developed
under conditions which were first ordained, and have been continually
supervised by the providence of God</i>. God is the Father of
humanity, and he is also the Guide and Educator of our race.
As "the offspring of God," humanity is not a bare, indeterminate
potentiality, but a living energy, an active reason, having
definite qualities, and inheriting fundamental principles and
necessary ideas which constitute it "the image and likeness of
God." And though it has suffered a moral lapse, and, in the
exercise of its freedom, has become alienated from the life of
God, yet God has never abandoned the human race. He still
"magnifies man, and sets his heart upon him." "He visits
him every morning, and tries him every moment." "The inspiration
of the Almighty still gives him understanding." The
illumination of the Divine Logos still "teacheth man knowledge."
The Spirit of God still comes near to and touches
with strong emotion every human heart. "God has never left
himself without a witness" in any nation, or in any age. The
providence of God has always guided the dispersions and migrations
of the families of the earth, and presided over and
directed the education of the race. "He has foreordained the
times of each nation's existence, and fixed the geographical
boundaries of their habitations, <i>in order that they should seek
the Lord</i>, and feel after and find Him who is not far from any
one of us." The religions of the ancient world were the painful
effort of the human spirit to return to its true rest and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="vii" id="vii">vii</a></span>
centre--the struggle to "find Him" who is so intimately near
to every human heart, and who has never ceased to be the
want of the human race. The philosophies of the ancient
world were the earnest effort of human reason to reconcile the
finite and the infinite, the human and the Divine, the subject
and God. An overruling Providence, which makes even the
wrath of man to praise Him, took up all these sincere, though
often mistaken, efforts into his own plan, and made them sub-serve
the purpose of redemption. They aided in developing
among the nations "the desire of salvation," and in preparing
the world for the advent of the Son of God. The entire course
and history of Divine providence, in every nation, and in every
age, has been directed towards the one grand purpose of "reconciling
all things to Himself." Christianity, as a comprehensive
scheme of reconciliation, embracing "all things," can
not, therefore, be properly studied apart from the ages of earnest
thought, of profound inquiry, and of intense religious feeling
which preceded it. To despise the religions of the ancient
world, to sneer at the efforts and achievements of the old philosophers,
or even to cut them off in thought from all relation
to the plans and movements of that Providence which has
cared for, and watched over, and pitied, and guided all the
nations of the earth, is to refuse to comprehend Christianity
itself.</p>

<p>The author is not indifferent to the possibility that his purpose
may be misconceived. The effort may be regarded by
many conscientious and esteemed theologians with suspicion
and mistrust. They can not easily emancipate themselves
from the ancient prejudice against speculative thought. Philosophy
has always been regarded by them as antagonistic to
Christian faith. They are inspired by a commendable zeal for
the honor of dogmatic theology. Every essay towards a profounder
conviction, a broader faith in the unity of all truth, is
branded with the opprobrious name of "rationalism." Let us
not be terrified by a harmless word. Surely religion and right
reason must be found in harmony. The author believes, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="viii" id="viii">viii</a></span>
Bacon, that "the foundation of all religion is right reason."
The abnegation of reason is not the evidence of faith, but the
confession of despair. Sustained by these convictions, he
submits this humble contribution to theological science to the
thoughtful consideration of all lovers of Truth, and of Christ,
the fountain of Truth. He can sincerely ask upon it the
blessing of Him in whose fear it has been written, and whose
cause it is the purpose of his life to serve.</p>

<p>The second series, on "Christianity and Modern Thought,"
is in an advanced state of preparation for the press.</p>

<blockquote>
"<i>Ye men of Athens</i>, all things which I behold bear witness to your carefulness
in religion; for, as I passed through your city and beheld the objects
of your worship, I found amongst them an altar with this inscription,
TO THE UNKNOWN GOD; whom, therefore, ye worship, though ye know;
Him not, Him declare I unto you. God who made the world and all things
therein, seeing He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples
made with hands; neither is He served by the hands of men, as though he
needed any thing; for He giveth unto all life, and breath, and all things.
And He made of one blood all the nations of mankind to dwell upon the face
of the whole earth; and ordained to each the appointed seasons of their existence,
and the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek God, if
haply they might feel after Him and find Him, though he be not far from
every one of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
of your own poets have said, <i>For we are also His offspring</i>. Forasmuch,
then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead
is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by the art and device of
man. Howbeit, those past times of ignorance God hath overlooked; but now
He commandeth all men everywhere to repent, because He hath appointed
a day wherein He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom
He hath ordained; whereof He hath given assurance unto all, in that He
hath raised Him from the dead."--Acts xvii. 22-31.

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>ATHENS, AND THE MEN OF ATHENS.</h3>

<blockquote>
"Is it not worth while, for the sake of the history of men and nations, to
study the surface of the globe in its relation to the inhabitants thereof?"--Goethe.
</blockquote>

<p><p>There is no event recorded in the annals of the early
church so replete with interest to the Christian student,
or which takes so deep a hold on the imagination, and the sympathies
of him who is at all familiar with the history of Ancient
Greece, as the one recited above. Here we see the Apostle
Paul standing on the Areopagus at Athens, surrounded by
the temples, statues, and altars, which Grecian art had consecrated
to Pagan worship, and proclaiming to the inquisitive
Athenians, "the strangers" who had come to Athens for business
or for pleasure, and the philosophers and students of the
Lyceum, the Academy, the Stoa, and the Garden, "<i>the unknown
God</i>."</p>

<p>Whether we dwell in our imagination on the artistic grandeur
and imposing magnificence of the city in which Paul
found himself a solitary stranger, or recall the illustrious
names which by their achievements in arts and philosophy
have shed around the city of Athens an immortal glory,--or
whether, fixing our attention on the lonely wanderer amid the
porticoes, and groves, and temples of this classic city, we attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="14"> </a></span>
to conceive the emotion which stirred his heart as he
beheld it "wholly given to idolatry;" or whether we contrast
the sublime, majestic theism proclaimed by Paul with the degrading
polytheism and degenerate philosophy which then prevailed
in Athens, or consider the prudent and sagacious manner
in which the apostle conducts his argument in view of the
religious opinions and prejudices of his audience, we can not
but feel that this event is fraught with lessons of instruction to
the Church in every age.</p>

<p>That the objects which met the eye of Paul on every hand,
and the opinions he heard everywhere expressed in Athens,
must have exerted a powerful influence upon the current of his
thoughts, as well as upon the state of his emotions, is a legitimate
and natural presumption. Not only was "his spirit
stirred within him"--his heart deeply moved and agitated
when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry--but his thoughtful,
philosophic mind would be engaged in pondering those
deeply interesting questions which underlie the whole system
of Grecian polytheism. The circumstances of the hour would,
no doubt, in a large degree determine the line of argument,
the form of his discourse, and the peculiarities of his phraseology.
The more vividly, therefore, we can represent the
scenes and realize the surrounding incidents; the more thoroughly
we can enter into sympathy with the modes of thought
and feeling peculiar to the Athenians; the more perfectly we
can comprehend the spirit and tendency of the age; the more
immediate our acquaintance with the religious opinions and
philosophical ideas then prevalent in Athens, the more perfect
will be our comprehension of the apostle's argument, the deeper
our interest in his theme. Some preliminary notices of
Athens and "the Men of Athens" will therefore be appropriate
as introductory to a series of discourses on Paul's sermon
on Mars' Hill.</p>

<p>The peculiar connection that subsists between Geography
and History, between a people and the country they inhabit,
will justify the extension of our survey beyond the mere topography
<span class="pagenum"><a name="15" >15</a></span>
of Athens. The people of the entire province of Attica
were called Athenians (<i>Αθηναίοι</i>) in their relation to the state,
and Attics <i>(Αττικοί</i>) in regard to their manners, customs, and
dialect.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a>
<a href="#footnote1"><sup class="sml">1</sup></a> The climate and the scenery, the forms of contour
and relief, the geographical position and relations of Attica,
and, indeed, of the whole peninsula of Greece, must be taken
into our account if we would form a comprehensive judgment
of the character of the Athenian people.</p>

<p>The soil on which a people dwell, the air they breathe, the
mountains and seas by which they are surrounded, the skies
that overshadow them,--all these exert a powerful influence on
their pursuits, their habits, their institutions, their sentiments,
and their ideas. So that could we clearly group, and fully
grasp all the characteristics of a region--its position, configuration,
climate, scenery, and natural products, we could, with
tolerable accuracy, determine what are the characteristics of
the people who inhabit it. A comprehensive knowledge of the
physical geography of any country will therefore aid us materially
in elucidating the natural history, and, to some extent,
the moral history of its population. "History does not stand
<i>outside</i> of nature, but in her very heart, so that the historian
only grasps a people's character with true precision when he
keeps in full view its geographical position, and the influences
which its surroundings have wrought upon it."<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a>

<p>It is, however, of the utmost consequence the reader should
understand that there are two widely different methods of treating
this deeply interesting subject--methods which proceed on
fundamentally opposite views of man and of nature. One
method is that pursued by Buckle in his "History of Civilization
in England." The tendency of his work is the assertion
of the supremacy of material conditions over the development
of human history, and indeed of every individual mind. Here
man is purely passive in the hands of nature. Exterior conditions
are the chief, if not the <i>only</i> causes of man's intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="16" >16</a></span>
and social development. So that, such a climate and soil,
such aspects of nature and local circumstances being given,
such a nation necessarily follows.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a>
<a href="#footnote3"><sup class="sml">3</sup></a> The other method is that
of Carl Ritter, Arnold Guyot, and Cousin.<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a>
<a href="#footnote4"><sup class="sml">4</sup></a> These take account
of the freedom of the human will, and the power of man
to control and modify the forces of nature. They also take account
of the original constitution of man, and the primitive type
of nations; and they allow for results arising from the mutual
conflict of geographical conditions. And they, especially, recognize
the agency of a Divine Providence controlling those
forces in nature by which the configuration of the earth's surface
is determined, and the distribution of its oceans, continents,
and islands is secured; and a providence, also, directing
the dispersions and migrations of nations--determining the
times of each nation's existence, and fixing the geographical
bounds of their habitation, all in view of the <i>moral</i> history and
spiritual development of the race,--"that they may feel after,
and find the living God." The relation of man and nature is
not, in their estimation, a relation of cause and effect. It is a
relation of adjustment, of harmony, and of reciprocal action
and reaction. "Man is not"--says Cousin--"an effect, and
nature the cause, but there is between man and nature a manifest
harmony of general laws."... "Man and nature are two
great effects which, coming from the same cause, bear the same
characteristics; so that the earth, and he who inhabits it, man
and nature, are in perfect harmony."<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a>
<a href="#footnote5"><sup class="sml">5</sup></a> God has created both
man and the universe, and he has established between them a
striking harmony. The earth was made for man; not simply
to supply his physical wants, but also to minister to his intellectual
and moral development. The earth is not a mere
dwelling-place of nations, but a school-house, in which God
himself is superintending the education of the race. Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="17" >17</a></span>
we must not only study the <i>events</i> of history in their chronological
order, but we must study the earth itself as the <i>theatre</i> of
history. A knowledge of all the circumstances, both physical
and moral, in the midst of which events take place, is absolutely
necessary to a right judgment of the events themselves.
And we can only elucidate properly the character of the actors
by a careful study of all their geographical and ethological conditions.</p>

<p>It will be readily perceived that, in attempting to estimate
the influence which exterior conditions exert in the determination
of national character, we encounter peculiar difficulties.
We can not in these studies expect the precision and accuracy
which is attained in the mathematical, or the purely physical
sciences. We possess no control over the "materiel" of our
inquiry; we have no power of placing it in new conditions, and
submitting it to the test of new experiments, as in the physical
sciences. National character is a <i>complex</i> result--a product
of the action and reaction of primary and secondary causes.
It is a conjoint effect of the action of the primitive elements
and laws originally implanted in humanity by the Creator, of
the free causality and self-determining power of man, and of
all the conditions, permanent and accidental, within which the
national life has been developed. And in cases where <i>physical</i>
and <i>moral</i> causes are blended, and reciprocally conditioned
and modified in their operation;--where primary results undergo
endless modifications from the influence of surrounding
circumstances, and the reaction of social and political institutions;--and
where each individual of the great aggregate
wields a causal power that obeys no specific law, and by his
own inherent power sets in motion new trains of causes which
can not be reduced to statistics, we grant that we are in possession
of no instrument of exact analysis by which the complex
phenomena of national character may be reduced to primitive
elements. All that we can hope is, to ascertain, by
psychological analysis, what are the fundamental ideas and
laws of humanity; to grasp the exterior conditions which are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="18" >18</a></span>
on all hands, recognized as exerting a powerful influence upon
national character; to watch, under these lights, the manifestations
of human nature on the theatre of history, and then apply
the principles of a sound historic criticism to the recorded
opinions of contemporaneous historians and their immediate
successors. In this manner we may expect, at least, to approximate
to a true judgment of history.</p>

<p>There are unquestionably fundamental powers and laws in
human nature which have their development in the course of
history. There are certain primitive ideas, imbedded in the
constitution of each individual mind, which are revealed in the
universal consciousness of our race, under the conditions of
experience--the exterior conditions of physical nature and human
society. Such are the ideas of cause and substance; of
unity and infinity, which govern all the processes of discursive
thought, and lead us to the recognition of Being <i>in se</i>;--such
the ideas of right, of duty, of accountability, and of retribution,
which regulate all the conceptions we form of our relations to
all other moral beings, and constitute <i>morality</i>;--such the ideas
of order, of proportion, and of harmony, which preside in the
realms of art, and constitute the beau-ideal of <i>esthetics</i>;--such
the ideas of God, the soul, and immortality, which rule in the
domains of <i>religion</i>, and determine man a religious being.
These constitute the identity of human nature under all circumstances;
these characterize humanity in all conditions.
Like permanent germs in vegetable life, always producing the
same species of plants; or like fundamental types in the animal
kingdom, securing the same homologous structures in all
classes and orders; so these fundamental ideas in human nature
constitute its sameness and unity, under all the varying
conditions of life and society. The acorn must produce an
oak, and nothing else. The grain of wheat must always produce
its kind. The offspring of man must always bear his
image, and always exhibit the same fundamental characteristics,
not only in his corporeal nature, but also in his mental
constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="19">19</a></span></p>

<p>But the germination of every seed depends on conditions <i>ab
extra</i>, and all germs are modified, in their development, by geographical
and climatal surroundings. The development of
the acorn into a mature and perfect oak greatly depends on the
exterior conditions of soil, and moisture, light, and heat. By
these it may be rendered luxuriant in its growth, or it may be
stunted in its growth. It may barely exist under one class of
conditions, or it may perish under another. The Brassica oleracea,
in its native habitat on the shore of the sea, is a bitter
plant with wavy sea-green leaves; in the cultivated garden it
is the cauliflower. The single rose, under altered conditions,
becomes a double rose; and creepers rear their stalks and
stand erect. Plants, which in a cold climate are annuals, become
perennial when transported to the torrid zone.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a>
<a href="#footnote6"><sup class="sml">6</sup></a> And so
human nature, fundamentally the same under all circumstances,
may be greatly modified, both physically and mentally, by geographical,
social, and political conditions. The corporeal nature
of man--his complexion, his physiognomy, his stature;
the intellectual nature of man--his religious, ethical, and esthetical
ideas are all modified by his surroundings. These
modifications, of which all men dwelling in the same geographical
regions, and under the same social and political institutions,
partake, constitute the <i>individuality</i> of nations. Thus,
whilst there is a fundamental basis of unity in the corporeal
and spiritual nature of man, the causes of diversity are to be
sought in the circumstances in which tribes and nations are
placed in the overruling providence of God.</p>

<p>The power which man exerts over material conditions, by
virtue of his intelligence and freedom, is also an important element
which, in these studies, we should not depreciate or ignore.
We must accept, with all its consequences, the dictum
of universal consciousness that man is <i>free</i>. He is not absolutely
subject to, and moulded by nature. He has the power
to control the circumstances by which he is surrounded--to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="20">20</a></span>
originate new social and physical conditions--to determine his
own individual and responsible character--and he can wield a
mighty influence over the character of his fellow-men. Individual
men, as Lycurgus, Solon, Pericles, Alexander, Cæsar,
and Napoleon have left the impress of their own mind and
character upon the political institutions of nations, and, in
indirect manner, upon the character of succeeding generations
of men. Homer, Plato, Cicero, Bacon, Kant, Locke, Newton,
Shakspeare, Milton have left a deep and permanent impression
upon the forms of thought and speech, the language and
literature, the science and philosophy of nations. And inasmuch
as a nation is the aggregate of individual beings endowed
with spontaneity and freedom, we must grant that exterior conditions
are not omnipotent in the formation of national character.
Still the free causality of man is exercised within a narrow
field. "There is a strictly necessitative limitation drawing
an impassable boundary-line around the area of volitional freedom."
The human will "however subjectively free" is often
"objectively unfree;" thus a large "uniformity of volitions" is
the natural consequence.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a>
<a href="#footnote7"><sup class="sml">7</sup></a> The child born in the heart of China,
whilst he may, in his personal freedom, develop such traits
of character as constitute his individuality, must necessarily be
conformed in his language, habits, modes of thought, and religious
sentiments to the spirit of his country and age. We no
more expect a development of Christian thought and character
in the centre of Africa, unvisited by Christian teaching, than
we expect to find the climate and vegetation of New England.
And we no more expect that a New England child shall be a
Mohammedan, a Parsee, or a Buddhist, than that he shall have
an Oriental physiognomy, and speak an Oriental language.
Indeed it is impossible for a man to exist in human society
without partaking in the spirit and manners of his country and
his age. Thus all the individuals of a nation represent, in a
greater or less degree, the spirit of the nation. They who
do this most perfectly are the <i>great</i> men of that nation, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="21">21</a></span>
they are at once both the product and the impersonation of
their country and their age. "We allow ourselves to think of
Shakspeare, or of Raphael, or of Phidias as having accomplished
their work by the power of their individual genius, but
greatness like theirs is never more than the highest degree of
perfection which prevails widely around it, and forms the
environment in which it grows. No such single mind in single
contact with the facts of nature could have created a Pallas,
a Madonna, or a Lear; such vast conceptions are the
growth of ages, the creation of a nation's spirit; and the artist
and poet, filled full with the power of that spirit, but gave it
form, and nothing but form. Nor would the form itself have
been attained by any isolated talent. No genius can dispense
with experience.... Noble conceptions already existing, and a
noble school of execution which will launch mind and hand
upon their true courses, are indispensable to transcendent excellence.
Shakspeare's plays were as much the offspring of
the long generations who had pioneered the road for him, as
the discoveries of Newton were the offspring of those of Copernicus."<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a>
<a href="#footnote8"><sup class="sml">8</sup></a>
The principles here enounced apply with equal force
to philosophers and men of science. The philosophy of Plato
was but the ripened fruit of the pregnant thoughts and seminal
utterances of his predecessors,--Socrates, Anaxagoras, and
Pythagoras; whilst all of them do but represent the general
tendency and spirit of their country and their times. The
principles of Lord Bacon's "Instauratio Magna" were incipient
in the "Opus Majus" of Roger Bacon, the Franciscan friar.
The sixteenth century matured the thought of the thirteenth
century. The inductive method in scientific inquiry was immanent
in the British mind, and the latter Bacon only gave to it
a permanent form. It is true that great men have occasionally
appeared on the stage of history who, like the reformers Luther
and Wesley, have seemed to be in conflict with the prevailing
spirit of their age and nation, but these men were the creations
of a providence--that providence which, from time to time, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="22">22</a></span>
<i>supernaturally</i> interposed in the moral history of our race by
corrective and remedial measures. These men were inspired
and led by a spirit which descended from on high. And yet
even they had their precursors and harbingers. Wyckliffe and
John Huss, and Jerome of Prague are but the representatives
of numbers whose names do not grace the historic page, who
pioneered the way for Luther and the Reformation. And no
one can read the history of that great movement of the sixteenth
century without being persuaded there were thousands
of Luther's predecessors and contemporaries who, like Staupitz
and Erasmus, lamented the corruptions of the Church of
Rome, and only needed the heroic courage of Luther to make
them reformers also. Whilst, therefore, we recognize a free
causal power in man, by which he determines his individual
and responsible character, we are compelled to recognize the
general law, that national character is mainly the result of those
geographical and ethological, and political and religious conditions
in which the nations have been placed in the providence
of God.</p>

<p>Nations, like persons, have an <i>Individuality</i>. They present
certain characteristic marks which constitute their proper identity,
and separate them from the surrounding nations of the
earth; such, for example, as complexion, physiognomy, language,
pursuits, customs, institutions, sentiments, ideas. The
individuality of a nation is determined mainly from <i>without</i>, and
not, like human individuality, from within. The laws of a
man's personal character have their home in the soul; and the
peculiarities and habits, and that conduct of life, which constitute
his responsible character are, in a great degree, the consequence
of his own free choice. But dwelling, as he does, in society,
where he is continually influenced by the example and
opinions of his neighbors; subject, as he is, to the ceaseless
influence of climate, scenery, and other terrestrial conditions,
the characteristics which result from these relations, and which
are common to all who dwell in the same regions, and under
the same institutions, constitute a national individuality. Individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="23">23</a></span>
character is <i>variable</i> under the same general conditions,
national character is <i>uniform</i>, because it results from
causes which operate alike upon all individuals.</p>

<p>Now, that man's complexion, his pursuits, his habits, his
ideas are greatly modified by his geographical surroundings, is
the most obvious of truths. No one doubts that the complexion
of man is greatly affected by climatic conditions. The appearance,
habits, pursuits of the man who lives within the tropics
must, necessarily, differ from those of the man who dwells
within the temperate zone. No one expects that the dweller
on the mountain will have the same characteristics as the man
who resides on the plains; or that he whose home is in the interior
of a continent will have the same habits as the man
whose home is on the islands of the sea. The denizen of the
primeval forest will most naturally become a huntsman. The
dweller on the extended plain, or fertile mountain slope, will
lead a pastoral, or an agricultural life. Those who live on the
margin of great rivers, or the borders of the sea, will "do business
on the great waters." Commerce and navigation will be
their chief pursuits. The people whose home is on the margin
of the lake, or bay, or inland sea, or the thickly studded archipelago,
are mostly fishermen. And then it is a no less obvious
truth that men's pursuits exert a moulding influence on
their habits, their forms of speech, their sentiments, and their
ideas. Let any one take pains to observe the peculiarities
which characterize the huntsman, the shepherd, the agriculturist,
or the fisherman, and he will be convinced that their occupations
stamp the whole of their thoughts and feelings; color
all their conceptions of things outside their own peculiar field;
direct their simple philosophy of life; and give a tone, even, to
their religious emotions.</p>

<p>The general aspects of nature, the climate and the scenery,
exert an appreciable and an acknowledged influence on the
<i>mental</i> characteristics of a people. The sprightliness and vivacity
of the Frank, the impetuosity of the Arab, the immobility
of the Russ, the rugged sternness of the Scot, the repose and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="24">24</a></span>
dreaminess of the Hindoo are largely due to the country in
which they dwell, the air they breathe, the food they eat, and
the landscapes and skies they daily look upon. The nomadic
Arab is not only indebted to the country in which he dwells for
his habit of hunting for daily food, but for that love of a free,
untrammelled life, and for those soaring dreams of fancy in
which he so ardently delights. Not only is the Swiss determined
by the peculiarities of his geographical position to lead
a pastoral life, but the climate, and mountain scenery, and
bracing atmosphere inspire him with the love of liberty. The
reserved and meditative Hindoo, accustomed to the profuse
luxuriance of nature, borrows the fantastic ideas of his mythology
from plants, and flowers, and trees. The vastness and infinite
diversity of nature, the colossal magnitude of all the
forms of animal and vegetable life, the broad and massive features
of the landscape, the aspects of beauty and of terror which
surround him, and daily pour their silent influences upon his
soul, give vividness, grotesqueness, even, to his imagination,
and repress his active powers. His mental character bears a
peculiar and obvious relation to his geographical surroundings.<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a>

<p>The influence of external nature on the imagination--the
<i>creative</i> faculty in man--is obvious and remarkable. It reveals
itself in all the productions of man--his architecture, his
sculpture, his painting, and his poetry. Oriental architecture
is characterized by the boldness and massiveness of all its
parts, and the monotonous uniformity of all its features. This
is but the expression, in a material form, of that shadowy feeling
of infinity, and unity, and immobility which an unbroken
continent of vast deserts and continuous lofty mountain chains
would naturally inspire. The simple grandeur and perfect harmony
and graceful blending of light and shade so peculiar to
Grecian architecture are the product of a country whose area
is diversified by the harmonious blending of land and water,
mountain and plain, all bathed in purest light, and canopied
with skies of serenest blue. And they are also the product of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="25">25</a></span>
a country where man is released from the imprisonment within
the magic circle of surrounding nature, and made conscious of
his power and freedom. In Grecian architecture, therefore,
there is less of the massiveness and immobility of nature, and
more of the grace and dignity of man. It adds to the idea of
permanence a <i>vital</i> expression. "The Doric column," says
Vitruvius, "has the proportion, strength, and beauty of man."
The Gothic architecture had its birthplace among a people who
had lived and worshipped for ages amidst the dense forests of
the north, and was no doubt an imitation of the interlacing of
the overshadowing trees. The clustered shaft, and lancet
arch, and flowing tracery, reflect the impression which the surrounding
scenery had woven into the texture of the Teutonic
mind.</p>

<p>The history of painting and of sculpture will also show that
the varied "styles of art" are largely the result of the aspects
which external nature presented to the eye of man. Oriental
sculpture, like its architecture, was characterized by massiveness
of form and tranquillity of expression; and its painting
was, at best, but colored sculpture. The most striking objects
are colossal figures, in which the human form is strangely combined
with the brute, as in the winged bulls of Nineveh and
the sphinxes of Egypt. Man is regarded simply as a part of
nature, he does not rise above the plane of animal life. The
soul has its immortality only in an eternal metempsychosis--a
cycle of life which sweeps through all the brute creation. But
in Grecian sculpture we have less of nature, more of man; less
of massiveness, more of grace and elegance; less repose, and
more of action. Now the connection between these styles of
art, and the countries in which they were developed, is at once
suggested to the thoughtful mind.</p>

<p>And then, finally, the literature of a people equally reveals
the impress of surrounding cosmical conditions. "The poems
of Ossian are but the echo of the wild, rough, cloudy highlands
of his Scottish home." The forest songs of the wild Indian,
the negro's plaintive melodies in the rice-fields of Carolina, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="26">26</a></span>
refrains in which the hunter of Kamtchatka relates his adventures
with the polar bear, and in which the South Sea Islander
celebrates his feats and dangers on the deep, all betoken the
influence which the scenes of daily life exert upon the thoughts
and feelings of our race. "To what an extent nature can express
herself in, and modify the culture of the individual, as
well as of an entire people, can be seen on Ionian soil in the
verse of Homer, which, called forth under the most favorable
sky, and on the most luxuriant shore of the Grecian archipelago,
not only charms us to-day, but bearing this impress, has
determined what shall be the classic form throughout all coming
time."<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote10"

(return) </a> See Ritter, pp. 288, 289. Poetic art has unquestionably its <i>geographical</i>
distributions like the fauna and flora of the globe. "If you love the images,
not merely of a rich, but of a luxuriant fancy; if you are pleased with the
most daring flights; if you would see a poetic creation full of wonders, then
turn your eye to the poetry of the <i>orient</i>, where all forms appear in purple;
where each flower glows like the morning ray resting on the earth. But if,
on the contrary, you prefer depth of thought, and earnestness of reflection;
if you delight in the colossal, yet pale forms, which float about in mist, and
whisper of the mysteries of the spirit-land, and of the vanity of all things, except
honor, then I must point you to the hoary <i>north</i>.... Or if you sympathize
with that deep feeling, that longing of the soul, which does not linger on the
earth, but evermore looks up to the azure tent of the stars, where happiness
dwells, where the unquiet of the beating heart is still, then you must resort to
the romantic poetry of the <i>west</i>."--"<i>Study of Greek Literature</i>," Bishop
Esaias Tegnér, p. 38.</blockquote>

<p>In seeking, therefore, to determine correctly what are the
characteristics of a nation, we must endeavor to trace how far
the physical constitution of that people, their temperament,
their habits, their sentiments, and their ideas have been formed,
or modified, under the surrounding geographical conditions,
which, as we have seen, greatly determine a nation's individuality.
Guided by these lights, let us approach the study of
"<i>the men of Athens</i>."</p>

<p><i>Attica</i>, of which Athens was the capital, and whose entire
populations were called "Athenians," was the most important
of all the Hellenic states. It is a triangular peninsula, the
base of which is defined by the high mountain ranges of Cithæron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="27">27</a></span>
and Parnes, whilst the two other sides are washed by the
sea, having their vertex at the promontory of Sunium, or Cape
Colonna. The prolongation of the south-western line towards
the north until it reaches the base at the foot of Mount Cithæron,
served as the line of demarkation between the Athenian
territory and the State of Megara. Thus Attica may be generally
described as bounded on the north-east by the channel
of the Negropont; on the south-west by the gulf of Ægina and
part of Megara; and on the north-west by the territory which
formed the ancient Bœotia, including within its limits an area
of about 750 miles.<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a>
<a href="#footnote11"><sup class="sml">11</sup></a></p>

<p>Hills of inferior elevation connect the mountain ranges of
Cithæron and Parnes with the mountainous surface of the south-east
of the peninsula. These hills, commencing with the promontory
of Sunium itself, which forms the vertex of the triangle,
rise gradually on the south-east to the round summit of Hymettus,
and onward to the higher peak of Pentelicus, near Marathon,
on the east. The rest of Attica is all a plain, one reach
of which comes down to the sea on the south, at the very base
of Hymettus. Here, about five miles from the shore, an abrupt
rock rises from the plain, about 200 feet high, bordered on the
south by lower eminences. That rock is the Acropolis. Those
lower eminences are the Areopagus, the Pmyx, and the Museum.
In the valley formed by these four hills we have the Agora,
and the varied undulations of these hills determine the features
of the city of Athens.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a>

<p>Nearly all writers on the topography of Athens derive their
materials from Pausanias, who visited the city in the early part
of the second century, and whose "Itinerary of Greece" is
still extant.<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a>
<a href="#footnote13"><sup class="sml">13</sup></a> He entered the city by the Peiraic gate, the same
gate at which Paul entered some sixty years before. We shall
place ourselves under his guidance, and, so far as we are able,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="28">28</a></span>
follow the same course, supplying some omissions, as we go
along, from other sources. On entering the city, the first building
which arrested the attention of Pausanias was the Pompeium,
so called because it was the depository of the sacred vessels,
and also of the garments used in the annual procession
in honor of Athena (Minerva), the tutelary deity of Athens,
from whom the city derived its name. Near this edifice stood
a temple of Demeter (Ceres), containing statues of that goddess,
of her daughter Persephone, and of Iacchus, all executed by
Praxiteles; and beyond were several porticoes leading from
the city gates to the outer Ceramicus, while the intervening
space was occupied by various temples, the Gymnasium of
Hermes, and the house of Polytion, the most magnificent private
residence in Athens.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote13"
name="footnote13"><b>Footnote 13: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag13">
(return) </a> The account here given of the topography of Athens is derived mainly
from the article on "Athens" in the <i>Encyc. Brit.</i></blockquote>

<p>There were two places in Athens known by the name of
Ceramicus, one without the walls, forming part of the suburbs;
and the other within the walls, embracing a very important
section of the city. The outer Ceramicus was covered with
the sepulchres of the Athenians who had been slain in battle,
and buried at the public expense; it communicated with the
inner Ceramicus by the gate Dipylum. The Ceramicus within
the city probably included the Agora, the Stoa Basileios, and
the Stoa Pœcile, besides various other temples and public
buildings.</p>

<p>Having fairly passed the city gates, a long street is before
us with a colonnade or cloister on either hand; and at the end
of this street, by turning to the left, we might go through the
whole Ceramicus to the open country, and the groves of the
Academy. But we turn to the right, and enter the Agora,--the
market-place, as it is called in the English translation of
the sacred narrative.</p>

<p>We are not, however, to conceive of the market-place at
Athens as bearing any resemblance to the bare, undecorated
spaces appropriated to business in our modern towns; but
rather as a magnificent public square, closed in by grand historic
buildings, of the highest style of architecture; planted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="29" >29</a></span>
with palm-trees in graceful distribution, and adorned with
statues of the great men of Athens and the deified heroes of
her mythology, from the hands of the immortal masters of the
plastic art. This "market-place" was the great centre of the
public life of the Athenians,--the meeting-place of poets, orators,
statesmen, warriors, and philosophers,--a grand resort for
leisure, for conversation, for business, and for news. Standing
in the Agora, and looking towards the south, is the <i>Museum,</i>
so called because it was believed that <i>Musæus</i>, the father of
poetry, was buried there. Towards the north-west is the <i>Pnyx,</i>
a sloping hill, partially levelled into an open area for political
assemblies. To the north is seen the craggy eminence of the
<i>Areopagus</i>, and on the north-east is the <i>Acropolis</i> towering high
above the scene, "the crown and glory of the whole."</p>

<p>The most important buildings of the Agora are the Porticoes
or cloisters, the most remarkable of which are the Stoa
Basileios, or Portico of the king; the Stoa Eleutherius, or Portico
of the Jupiter of Freedom; and the Stoa Pœcile, or Painted
Porch. These Porticoes were covered walks, the roof being
supported by columns, at least on one side, and by solid masonry
on the other. Such shaded walks are almost indispensable
in the south of Europe, where the people live much in the
open air, and they afford a grateful protection from the heat of
the sun, as well as a shelter from the rain. Seats were also
provided where the loungers might rest, and the philosophers
and rhetoricians sit down for intellectual conversation. The
"Stoic" school of philosophy derived its name from the circumstance
that its founder, Zeno, used to meet and converse
with his disciples under one of these porticoes,--the Stoa Pœcile.
These porticoes were not only built in the most magnificent
style of architecture, but adorned with paintings and
statuary by the best masters. On the roof of the Stoa Basileios
were statues of Theseus and the Day. In front of the Stoa
Eleutherius was placed the divinity to whom it was dedicated;
and within were allegorical paintings, celebrating the rise of
"the fierce democracy." The Stoa Pœcile derived its name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="30">30</a></span>
from the celebrated paintings which adorned its walls, and
which were almost exclusively devoted to the representation of
national subjects, as the contest of Theseus with the Amazons,
the more glorious struggle at Marathon, and the other achievements
of the Athenians; here also were suspended the shields
of the Scionæans of Thrace, together with those of the Lacedemonians,
taken at the island of Sphacteria.</p>

<p>It is beyond our purpose to describe all the public edifices,--the
temples, gymnasia, and theatres which crowd the Ceramic
area, and that portion of the city lying to the west and south
of the Acropolis. Our object is, if possible, to convey to the
reader some conception of the ancient splendor and magnificence
of Athens; to revive the scenes amidst which the Athenians
daily moved, and which may be presumed to have exerted
a powerful influence upon the manners, the taste, the habits of
thought, and the entire character of the Athenian people. To
secure this object we need only direct attention to the Acropolis,
which was crowded with the monuments of Athenian
glory, and exhibited an amazing concentration of all that
was most perfect in art, unsurpassed in excellence, and unrivalled
in richness and splendor. It was "the peerless gem of
Greece, the glory and pride of art, the wonder and envy of the
world."</p>

<p>The western side of the Acropolis, which furnished the only
access to the summit of the hill, was about 168 feet in breadth;
an opening so narrow that, to the artists of Pericles, it appeared
practicable to fill up the space with a single building, which, in
serving the purpose of a gateway to the Acropolis, should also
contribute to adorn, as well as fortify the citadel. This work,
the greatest achievement of civil architecture in Athens, which
rivalled the Parthenon in felicity of execution, and surpassed it
in boldness and originality of design, consisted of a grand central
colonnade closed by projecting wings. This incomparable
edifice, built of Pentelic marble, received the name of Propylæa
from its forming the vestibule to the five-fold gates by which the
citadel was entered. In front of the right wing there stood a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="31">31</a></span>
small Ionic temple of pure white marble, dedicated to Niké
Apteros (Wingless Victory).</p>

<p>A gigantic flight of steps conducted from the five-fold gates
to the platform of the Acropolis, which was, in fact, one vast
composition of architecture and sculpture dedicated to the national
glory. Here stood the Parthenon, or temple of the Virgin
Goddess, the glorious temple which rose in the proudest
period of Athenian history to the honor of Minerva, and which
ages have only partially effaced. This magnificent temple, "by
its united excellences of materials, design, and decoration, internal
as well as external, has been universally considered the
most perfect which human genius ever planned and executed.
Its dimensions were sufficiently large to produce an impression
of grandeur and sublimity, which was not disturbed by any obtrusive
subdivision of parts; and, whether viewed at a small or
greater distance, there was nothing to divert the mind of the
spectator from contemplating the unity as well as majesty of
mass and outline; circumstances which form the first and most
remarkable characteristic of every Greek temple erected during
the purer ages of Grecian taste and genius."<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a>

<p>It would be impossible to convey any just and adequate
conception of the artistic decorations of this wonderful edifice.
The two pediments of the temple were decorated with magnificent
compositions of statuary, each consisting of about twenty
entire figures of colossal size; the one on the western pediment
representing the birth of Minerva, and the other, on the eastern
pediment, the contest between that goddess and Neptune for
the possession of Attica. Under the outer cornice were ninety-two
groups, raised in high relief from tablets about four feet
square, representing the victories achieved by her companions.
Round the inner frieze was presented the procession of the Parthenon
on the grand quinquennial festival of the Panathenæa.
The procession is represented as advancing in two parallel columns
from west to east; one proceeding along the northern,
the other along the southern side of the temple; part facing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="32">32</a></span>
inward after turning the angle of the eastern front, and part
meeting towards the centre of that front.</p>

<p>The statue of the virgin goddess, the work of Phidias, stood
in the eastern chamber of the cella, and was composed of ivory
and gold. It had but one rival in the world, the Jupiter Olympus
of the same famous artist. On the summit or apex of the
helmet was placed a sphinx, with griffins on either side. The
figure of the goddess was represented in an erect martial attitude,
and clothed in a robe reaching to the feet. On the breast
was a head of Medusa, wrought in ivory, and a figure of Victory
about four cubits high. The goddess held a spear in her hand,
and an ægis lay at her feet, while on her right, and near the
spear, was a figure of a serpent, believed to represent that of
Erichthonius.</p>

<p>According to Pliny, the entire height of the statue was twenty-six
cubits (about forty feet), and the artist, Phidias, had ingeniously
contrived that the gold with which the statue was encrusted
might be removed at pleasure. The battle of the Centaurs
and Lapithæ was carved upon the sandals; the battle of
the Amazons was represented on the ægis which lay at her feet,
and on the pedestal was sculptured the birth of Pandora.</p>

<p>The temple of Erechtheus, the most ancient structure in
Athens, stood on the northern side of the Acropolis. The
statue of Zeus Polieus stood between the Propylæa and the
Parthenon. The brazen colossus of Minerva, cast from the
spoils of Marathon, appears to have occupied the space between
the Erechtheium and the Propylæa, near the Pelasgic or northern
wall. This statue of the tutelary divinity of Athens and
Attica rose in gigantic proportions above all the buildings of
the Acropolis, the flashing of whose helmet plumes met the
sailor's eye as he approached from the Sunian promontory.
And the remaining space of the wide area was literally crowded
with statuary, amongst which were Theseus contending with
the Minotaur; Hercules strangling the serpents; the Earth
imploring showers from Jupiter; and Minerva causing the olive
to sprout, while Neptune raises the waves. After these works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="33" >33</a></span>
of art, it is needless to speak of others. It may be sufficient to
state that Pausanias mentions by name towards three hundred
remarkable statues which adorned this part of the city even
after it had been robbed and despoiled by its several conquerors.</p>

<p>The Areopagus, or hill of Ares (Mars), so called, it is said,
in consequence of that god having been the first person tried
there for the crime of murder, was, beyond all doubt, the rocky
height which is separated from the western end of the Acropolis
by a hollow, forming a communication between the northern
and southern divisions of the city. The court of the Areopagus
was simply an open space on the highest summit of the hill,
the judges sitting in the open air, on rude seats of stone, hewn
out of the solid rock. Near to the spot on which the court was
held was the sanctuary of the Furies, the avenging deities of
Grecian mythology, whose presence gave additional solemnity
to the scene. The place and the court were regarded by the
people with superstitious reverence.</p>

<p>This completes, our survey of the principal buildings, monuments,
and localities within the city of Athens. We do not imagine
we have succeeded in conveying any adequate idea of the
ancient splendor and glory of this city, which was not only the
capital of Attica, but also</p>

<p class="mid">
"The eye of Greece, mother of art and eloquence."
</p>

<p>We trust, however, that we have contributed somewhat towards
awakening in the reader's mind a deeper interest in these classic
scenes, and enabling him to appreciate, more vividly, the allusions
we may hereafter make to them.</p>

<p>The mere dry recital of geographical details, and topographical
notices is, however, of little interest in itself, and by itself.
A tract of country derives its chief interest from its historic <i>associations</i>--its
immediate relations to man. The events which
have transpired therein, the noble or ignoble deeds, the grand
achievements, or the great disasters of which it has been the
theatre, these constitute the living heart of its geography. Palestine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="34" >34</a></span>
has been rendered forever memorable, not by any remarkable
peculiarities in its climate or scenery, but by the fact
that it was the home of God's ancient people--the Hebrews
and still more, because the ardent imagination of the modern
traveller still sees upon its mountains and plains the lingering
footprints of the Son of God. And so Attica will always be
regarded as a classic land, because it was the theatre of the
most illustrious period of ancient history--<i>the period of youthful
vigor in the life of humanity, when viewed as a grand organic
whole</i>.</p>

<p>Here on a narrow spot of less superficies than the little
State of Rhode Island there flourished a republic which, in the
grandeur of her military and naval achievements, at Marathon,
Thermopylæ, Platæa, and Salamis, in the sublime creations of
her painters, sculptors, and architects, and the unrivalled productions
of her poets, orators, and philosophers, has left a lingering
glory on the historic page, which twenty centuries have
not been able to eclipse or dim. The names of Solon and
Pericles; of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; of Isocrates and
Demosthenes; of Myron, Phidias, and Praxiteles; of Herodotus,
Xenophon, and Thucydides; of Sophocles and Euripides,
have shed an undying lustre on Athens and Attica.</p>

<p>How much of this universal renown, this imperishable glory
attained by the Athenian people, is to be ascribed to their geographical
position and surroundings, and to the elastic, bracing
air, the enchanting scenery, the glorious skies, which poured
their daily inspiration on the Athenian mind, is a problem we
may scarcely hope to solve.</p>

<p>Of this, at least, we may be sure, that all these geographical
and cosmical conditions were ordained by God, and ordained,
also, for some noble and worthy end. That God, "the Father
of all the families of the earth," cared for the Athenian people
as much as for Jewish and Christian nations, we can not doubt.
That they were the subjects of a Providence, and that, in God's
great plan of human history, they had an important part to
fulfill, we must believe. That God "determined the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="35">35</a></span>
each nation's existence, and fixed the geographical bounds of
its habitation," is affirmed by Paul. And that the <i>specific</i> end
for which the nation had its existence was fulfilled, we have the
fullest confidence. <i>So far, therefore, as we can trace the relation
that subsists between the geographical position and surroundings
of that nation, and its national characteristics and actual history,
so far are we able to solve the problem of its destiny; and by so
much do we enlarge our comprehension of the plan of God in the
history of our race</i>.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Greece was favorable to the
freest commercial and maritime intercourse with the great historic
nations--those nations most advanced in science, literature,
and art. Bounded on the west by the Adriatic and Ionian
seas, by the Mediterranean on the south, and on the east by the
Ægean Sea, her populations enjoyed a free intercommunication
with the Egyptians, Hebrews, Persians, Phœnicians, Romans,
and Carthaginians. This peculiarity in the geographical position
of the Grecian peninsula could not fail to awaken in its
people a taste for navigation, and lead them to active commercial
intercourse with foreign nations.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a>
<a href="#footnote15"><sup class="sml">15</sup></a> The boundless oceans
on the south and east, the almost impassable mountains on the
west and north of Asia, presented insurmountable obstacles to
commercial intercourse. But the extended border-lands and
narrow inland seas of Southern Europe allured man, in presence
of their opposite shores, to the perpetual exchange of his productions.
An arm of the sea is not a barrier, but rather a tie
between the nations. Appearing to separate, it in reality draws
them together without confounding them.<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a>
<a href="#footnote16"><sup class="sml">16</sup></a> On such a theatre
we may expect that commerce will be developed on an extensive
scale.<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a>
<a href="#footnote17"><sup class="sml">17</sup></a> And, along with commerce, there will be increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="36">36</a></span>
activity in all departments of productive industry, and an enlarged
diffusion of knowledge. "Commerce," says Ritter, "is
the great mover and combiner of the world's activities." And
it also furnishes the channels through which flow the world's
ideas. Commerce, both in a material and moral point of view,
is the life of nations. Along with the ivory and ebony, the fabrics
and purple dyes, the wines and spices of the Syrian merchant,
there flowed into Greece the science of numbers and
of navigation, and the art of alphabetical writing from Phœnicia.
Along with the fine wheat, and embroidered linen, and riches
of the farther Indias which came from Egypt, there came, also,
into Greece some knowledge of the sciences of astronomy and
geometry, of architecture and mechanics, of medicine and
chemistry; together with the mystic wisdom of the distant
Orient. The scattered rays of light which gleamed in the eastern
skies were thus converged in Greece, as on a focal point,
to be rendered more brilliant by contact with the powerful Grecian
intellect, and then diffused throughout the western world.
Thus intercourse with surrounding nations, by commerce and
travel, contact therewith by immigrations and colonizations,
even collisions and invasions also, became, in the hands of a
presiding Providence, the means of diffusing knowledge, of
quickening and enlarging the active powers of man, and thus,
ultimately, of a higher civilization.</p>

<p>Then further, the peculiar configuration of Greece, the wonderful
complexity of its coast-line, its peninsular forms, the number
of its islands, and the singular distribution of its mountains,
all seem to mark it as the theatre of activity, of movement,
of individuality, and of freedom. An extensive continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="37" >37</a></span>
unbroken by lakes and inland seas, as Asia, where vast
deserts and high mountain chains separate the populations, is
the seat of immobility.<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a>
<a href="#footnote18"><sup class="sml">18</sup></a> Commerce is limited to the bare necessities
of life, and there are no inducements to movement, to
travel, and to enterprise. There are no conditions prompting
man to attempt the conquest of nature. Society is therefore
stationary as in China and India. Enfolded and imprisoned
within the overpowering vastness and illimitable sweep of nature,
man is almost unconscious of his freedom and his personality.
He surrenders himself to the disposal of a mysterious
"<i>fate</i>" and yields readily to the despotic sway of superhuman
powers. The State is consequently the reign of a single despotic
will. The laws of the Medes and Persians are unalterable.
But in Greece we have extended border-lands on the
coast of navigable seas; peninsulas elaborately articulated, and
easy of access. We have mountains sufficiently elevated to
shade the land and diversify the scenery, and yet of such a
form as not to impede communication. They are usually
placed neither in parallel chains nor in massive groups, but
are so disposed as to inclose extensive tracts of land admirably
adapted to become the seats of small and independent
communities, separated by natural boundaries, sometimes impossible
to overleap. The face of the interior country,--its
forms of relief, seemed as though Providence designed, from
the beginning, to keep its populations socially and politically
disunited. These difficulties of internal transit by land were,
however, counteracted by the large proportion of coast, and the
accessibility of the country by sea. The promontories and indentations
in the line of the Grecian coast are hardly less remarkable
than the peculiar elevations and depressions of the
surface. "The shape of Peloponnesus, with its three southern
gulfs, the Argolic, Laconian, and Messenian, was compared by
the ancient geographers to the leaf of a plane-tree: the Pagasæan
gulf on the eastern side of Greece, and the Ambrakian
gulf on the western, with their narrow entrances and considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="38" >38</a></span>
area, are equivalent to internal lakes: Xenophon boasts
of the double sea which embraces so large a portion of Attica;
Ephorus, of the triple sea by which Bœotia was accessible from
west, north, and south--the Eubœan strait, opening a long line
of country on both sides to coasting navigation. But the most
important of all Grecian gulfs are the Corinthian and Saronic,
washing the northern and north-eastern shores of Peloponnesus,
and separated by the narrow barrier of the Isthmus of
Corinth. The former, especially, lays open Ætolia, Phokis, and
Bœotia, as the whole northern coast of Peloponnesus, to water
approach.... It will thus appear that there was no part of
Greece proper which could be considered as out of the reach
of the sea, whilst most parts of it were easy of access. The sea
was thus the sole channel for transmitting improvements and
ideas as well as for maintaining sympathies" between the Hellenic
tribes.<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a>
<a href="#footnote19"><sup class="sml">19</sup></a> The sea is not only the grand highway of commercial
intercourse, but the empire of movement, of progress,
and of freedom. Here man is set free from the bondage imposed
by the overpowering magnitude and vastness of continental
and oceanic forms. The boisterous and, apparently, lawless
winds are made to obey his will. He mounts the sea as on a
fiery steed and "lays his hand upon her mane." And whilst
thus he succeeds, in any measure, to triumph over nature, he
wakes to conscious power and freedom. It is in this region of
contact and commingling of sea and land where man attains
the highest superiority. Refreshing our historic recollections,
and casting our eyes upon the map of the world, we can not
fail to see that all the most highly civilized nations have lived,
or still live, on the margin of the sea.</p>

<p>The peculiar configuration of the territory of Greece, its
forms of relief, "so like, in many respects, to Switzerland," could
not fail to exert a powerful influence on the character and destiny
of its people. Its inclosing mountains materially increased
their defensive power, and, at the same time, inspired
them with the love of liberty. Those mountains, as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="39">39</a></span>
seen, so unique in their distribution, were natural barriers
against the invasion of foreign nations, and they rendered each
separate community secure against the encroachments of the
rest. The pass of Thermopylæ, between Thessaly and Phocis,
that of Cithæron, between Bœotia and Attica; and the mountain
ranges of Oneion and Geraneia, along the Isthmus of Corinth,
were positions which could be defended against any force
of invaders. This signal peculiarity in the forms of relief protected
each section of the Greeks from being conquered, and
at the same time maintained their separate autonomy. The
separate states of Greece lived, as it were, in the presence of
each other, and at the same time resisted all influences and
all efforts towards a coalescence with each other, until the time
of Alexander. Their country, a word of indefinite meaning to
the Asiatic, conveyed to them as definite an idea as that of their
own homes. Its whole landscape, with all its historic associations,
its glorious monuments of heroic deeds, were perpetually
present to their eyes. Thus their patriotism, concentrated
within a narrow sphere, and kept alive by the sense of their individual
importance, their democratic spirit, and their struggles
with surrounding communities to maintain their independence,
became a strong and ruling passion. Their geographical surroundings
had, therefore, a powerful influence upon their political
institutions. Conquest, which forces nations of different
habits, characters, and languages into unity, is at last the parent
of degrading servitude. These nations are only held together,
as in the Roman empire, by the iron hand of military
power. The despot, surrounded by a foreign soldiery, appears
in the conquered provinces, simply to enforce tribute, and compel
obedience to his arbitrary will. But the small Greek communities,
protected by the barriers of their seas and gulfs and
mountains, escaped, for centuries, this evil destiny. The people,
united by identity of language and manners and religion,
by common interest and facile intercommunication, could readily
combine to resist the invasions of foreign nations, as well as
the encroachments of their own rulers. And they were able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="40" >40</a></span>
easily model their own government according to their own necessities
and circumstances and common interests, and to make
the end for which it existed the sole measure of the powers it
was permitted to wield.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a>

<p>The soil of Attica was not the most favorable to agricultural
pursuits. In many places it was stony and uneven, and a considerable
proportion was bare rock, on which nothing could be
grown. Not half the surface was capable of cultivation. In
this respect it may be fitly compared to some of the New England
States. The light, dry soil produced excellent barley, but
not enough of wheat for their own consumption. Demosthenes
informs us that Athens brought every year, from Byzantium,
four hundred thousand <i>medimni</i> of wheat. The alluvial plains,
under industrious cultivation, would furnish a frugal subsistence
for a large population, and the mildness of the climate allowed
all the more valuable products to ripen early, and go out of
season last. Such conditions, of course, would furnish motives
for skill and industry, and demand of the people frugal and
temperate habits. The luxuriance of a tropical climate tends
to improvidence and indolence. Where nature pours her fullness
into the lap of ease, forethought and providence are little
needed. There is none of that struggle for existence which
awakens sagacity, and calls into exercise the active powers of
man. But in a country where nature only yields her fruits as
the reward of toil, and yet enough to the intelligent culture of
the soil, there habits of patient industry must be formed. The
alternations of summer and winter excite to forethought and
providence, and the comparative poverty of the soil will prompt
to frugality. Man naturally aspires to improve his condition
by all the means within his power. He becomes a careful observer
of nature, he treasures up the results of observation, he
compares one fact with another and notes their relations, and
he makes new experiments to test his conclusions, and thus he
awakes to the vigorous exercise of all his powers. These physical
conditions must develop a hardy, vigorous, prudent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="41">41</a></span>
temperate race; and such, unquestionably, were the Greeks.
"Theophrastus, and other authors, amply attest the observant
and industrious agriculture prevalent in Greece. The culture
of the vine and olive appears to have been particularly elaborate
and the many different accidents of soil, level, and exposure
which were to be found, afforded to observant planters
materials for study and comparison."<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a>
<a href="#footnote21"><sup class="sml">21</sup></a> The Greeks were frugal
in their habits and simple in their modes of life. The barley
loaf seems to have been more generally eaten than the
wheaten loaf; this, with salt fish and vegetables, was the common
food of the population. Economy in domestic life was
universal. In their manners, their dress, their private dwellings,
they were little disposed to ostentation or display.</p>

<p>The climate of Attica is what, in physical geography, would
be called <i>maritime</i>. "Here are allied the continental vigor
and oceanic softness, in a fortunate union, mutually tempering
each other."<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a>
<a href="#footnote22"><sup class="sml">22</sup></a> The climate of the whole peninsula of Greece
seems to be distinguished from that of Spain and Italy, by
having more of the character of an inland region. The diversity
of local temperature is greater; the extremes of summer
and winter more severe. In Arcadia the snow has been found
eighteen inches thick in January, with the thermometer at 16°
Fahrenheit, and it sometimes lies on the ground for six weeks.
The summits of the central chains of Pindus and most of the
Albanian mountains are covered with snow from the beginning
of November to the end of March. In Attica, which, being
freely exposed to the sea, has in some measure an insular climate,
the winter sets in about the beginning of January.
About the middle of that month the snow begins to fall, but
seldom remains upon the plain for more than a few days, though
it lies on the summit of the mountain for a month.<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a>
<a href="#footnote23"><sup class="sml">23</sup></a> And then,
whilst Bœotia, which joins to Attica, is higher and colder, and
often covered with dense fogs, Attica is remarkable for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="42" >42</a></span>
wonderful transparency, dryness, and elasticity of its atmosphere.
All these climatal conditions exerted, no doubt, a modifying
influence upon the character of the inhabitants.<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a>
<a href="#footnote24"><sup class="sml">24</sup></a> In a
tropical climate man is enfeebled by excessive heat. His natural
tendency is to inaction and repose. His life is passed in
a "strenuous idleness." His intellectual, his reflective faculties
are overmastered by his physical instincts. Passion, sentiment,
imagination prevail over the sober exercises of his reasoning
powers. Poetry universally predominates over philosophy.
The whole character of Oriental language, religion, literature
is intensely imaginative. In the frozen regions of the frigid
zone, where a perpetual winter reigns, and where lichens and
mosses are the only forms of vegetable life, man is condemned
to the life of a huntsman, and depends mainly for his subsistence
on the precarious chances of the chase. He is consequently
nomadic in his habits, and barbarous withal. His
whole life is spent in the bare process of procuring a living.
He consumes a large amount of oleaginous food, and breathes
a damp heavy atmosphere, and is, consequently, of a dull
phlegmatic temperament. Notwithstanding his uncertain supplies
of food, he is recklessly improvident, and indifferent to all
the lessons of experience. Intellectual pursuits are all precluded.
There is no motive, no opportunity, and indeed no
disposition for mental culture. But in a temperate climate
man is stimulated to high mental activity. The alternations
of heat and cold, of summer and of winter, an elastic, fresh,
and bracing atmosphere, a diversity in the aspects of nature,
these develop a vivacity of temperament, a quickness of sensibility
as well as apprehension, and a versatility of feeling as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="43" >43</a></span>
well as genius. History marks out the temperate zone as the
seat of the refined and cultivated nations.</p>

<p>The natural scenery of Greece was of unrivalled grandeur--surpassing
Italy, perhaps every country in the world. It combined
in the highest degree every feature essential to the highest
beauty of a landscape except, perhaps, large rivers. But
this was more than compensated for by the proximity of the
sea, which, by its numerous arms, seemed to embrace the land
on nearly every side. Its mountains, encircled with zones of
wood, and capped with snow, though much lower than the Alps,
are as imposing by the suddenness of their elevation--"pillars
of heaven, the fosterers of enduring snows."<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a>
<a href="#footnote25"><sup class="sml">25</sup></a> Rich sheltered
plains lie at their feet, covered with an unequally woven mantle
of trees, and shrubs, and flowers,--"the verdant gloom of the
thickly-mantling ivy, the narcissus steeped in heavenly dew,
the golden-beaming crocus, the hardy and ever-fresh-sprouting
olive-tree,"<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a>
<a href="#footnote26"><sup class="sml">26</sup></a> and the luxuriant palm, which nourishes amid its
branches the grape swelling with juice. But it is the combination
of these features, in the most diversified manner, with
beautiful inland bays and seas, broken by headlands, inclosed
by mountains, and studded with islands of every form and
magnitude, which gives to the scenery of Greece its proud pre-eminence.
"Greek scenery," says Humboldt, "presents the
peculiar charm of an intimate blending of sea and land, of
shores adorned with vegetation, or picturesquely girt with rocks
gleaming in the light of aerial tints, and an ocean beautiful in
the play of the ever-changing brightness of its deep-toned
wave."<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a>
<a href="#footnote27"><sup class="sml">27</sup></a> And over all the serene, deep azure skies, occasionally
veiled by light fleecy clouds, with vapory purple mists resting
on the distant mountain tops. This glorious scenery of
Greece is evermore the admiration of the modern traveller.

<p>The effect of this scenery upon the character, the imagination,
the taste of the Athenians must have been immense.
Under the influence of such sublime objects, the human mind
becomes gifted as with inspiration, and is by nature filled with
poetic images. "Greece became the birth-place of taste, of
art, and eloquence, the chosen sanctuary of the muses, the prototype
of all that is graceful, and dignified, and grand in sentiment
and action."</p>

<p>And now, if we have succeeded in clearly presenting and
properly grouping the facts, and in estimating the influence of
geographical position and surroundings on national character,
we have secured the natural <i>criteria</i> by which we examine, and
even correct the portraiture of the Athenian character usually
presented by the historian.</p>

<p>The character of the Athenians has been sketched by Plutarch<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a>
<a href="#footnote29"><sup class="sml">29</sup></a>
with considerable minuteness, and his representations
have been permitted, until of late years, to pass unchallenged.
He has described them as at once passionate and placable,
easily moved to anger, and as easily appeased; fond of pleasantry
and repartee, and heartily enjoying a laugh; pleased to
hear themselves praised, and yet not annoyed by criticism and
censure; naturally generous towards those who were poor and
in humble circumstances, and humane even towards their enemies;
jealous of their liberties, and keeping even their rulers
in awe. In regard to their intellectual traits, he affirms their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="45">45</a></span>
minds were not formed for laborious research, and though they
seized a subject as it were by intuition, yet wanted patience and
perseverance for a thorough examination of all its bearings.
"An observation," says the writer of the article on "<i>Attica</i>,"
in the Encyclopædia Britannica, "more superficial in itself, and
arguing a greater ignorance of the Athenians, can not easily be
imagined." Plutarch lived more than three hundred years
after the palmy days of the Athenian Demos had passed away.
He was a Bœotian by birth, not an Attic, and more of a Roman
than a Greek in all his sympathies. We are tempted to regard
him as writing under the influence of prejudice, if not of envy.
He was scarcely reliable as a biographer, and as materials for
history his "Parallel Lives" have been pronounced "not altogether
trustworthy."<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a>

<p>That the Athenians were remarkable for the ardor and vivacity
of their temperament,--that they were liable to sudden
gusts of passion,--that they were inconstant in their affections,
intolerant of dictation, impatient of control, and hasty to resent
every assumption of superiority,--that they were pleased with
flattery, and too ready to lend a willing ear to the adulation of
the demagogue,--and that they were impetuous and brave,
yet liable to be excessively elated by success, and depressed
by misfortune, we may readily believe, because such traits of
character are in perfect harmony with all the facts and conclusions
already presented. Such characteristics were the natural
product of the warm and genial sunlight, the elastic bracing air,
the ethereal skies, the glorious mountain scenery, and the elaborate
blending of sea and land, so peculiar to Greece and the
whole of Southern Europe.<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a>
<a href="#footnote31"><sup class="sml">31</sup></a> These characteristics were shared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="46" >46</a></span>
in a greater or less degree by all the nations of Southern Europe
in ancient times, and they are still distinctive traits in the
Frenchman, the Italian, and the modern Greek.<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a>

and elasticity, so, also, had nature dealt most lovingly with the inhabitants
of this land. Throughout the whole being of the Greek there reigned
supreme a quick susceptibility, out of which sprang a gladsome serenity of
temper, and a keen enjoyment of life; acute sense, and nimbleness of apprehension;
a guileless and child-like feeling, full of trust and faith, combined
with prudence and forecast. These peculiarities lay so deeply imbedded
in the inmost nature of the Greeks that no revolutions of time and
circumstances have yet been able to destroy them; nay, it may be asserted
that even now, after centuries of degradation, they have not been wholly extinguished
in the inhabitants of ancient Hellas."--"<i>Education of the Moral
Sentiment amongst the Ancient Greeks</i>." By FREDERICK JACOBS, p. 320.</blockquote>

(return) </a> These are described by the modern historian and traveller as lively, versatile,
and witty. "The love of liberty and independence does not seem to
be rooted out of the national character by centuries of subjugation. They
love to command; but though they are loyal to a good government, they
are apt readily to rise when their rights and liberties are infringed. As
there is little love of obedience among them, so neither is there any toleration
of aristocratic pretensions."--<i>Encyc. Brit.</i>, art. "Greece."</blockquote>

<p>The consciousness of power, the feeling of independence,
the ardent love of freedom induced in the Athenian mind by
the objective freedom of movement which his geographical position
afforded, and that subordination and subserviency of
physical nature to man so peculiar to Greece, determined the
democratic character of all their political institutions. And
these institutions reacted upon the character of the people and
intensified their love of liberty. This passionate love of personal
freedom, amounting almost to disease, excited them to a
constant and almost distressing vigilance. And it is not to be
wondered at if it displayed itself in an extreme jealousy of their
rulers, an incessant supervision and criticism of all their proceedings,
and an intense and passionate hatred of tyrants and
of tyranny. The popular legislator or the successful soldier
might dare to encroach upon their liberties in the moment
when the nation was intoxicated and dazzled with their genius,
their prowess, and success; but a sudden revulsion of popular
feeling, and an explosion of popular indignation, would overturn
the one, and ostracism expel the other. Thus while inconstancy,
and turbulence, and faction seem to have been inseparable
from the democratic spirit, the Athenians were certainly
constant in their love of liberty, faithful in their affection
for their country,<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a>
<a href="#footnote33"><sup class="sml">33</sup></a> and invariable in their sympathy and admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="47" >47</a></span>
for that genius which shed glory upon their native land.
And then they were ever ready to repair the errors, and make
amends for the injustice committed under the influence of passionate
excitement, or the headlong impetuosity of their too ardent
temperament. The history of Greece supplies numerous
illustrations of this spirit. The sentence of death which had
been hastily passed on the inhabitants of Mytilene was, on sober
reflection, revoked the following day. The immediate repentance
and general sorrow which followed the condemnation
of the ten generals, as also of Socrates, are notable instances.</p>

(return) </a> When immense bribes were offered by the king of Persia to induce the
Athenians to detach themselves from the alliance with the rest of the
Hellenic States, she answered by the mouth of Aristides "that it was impossible
for all the gold in the world to tempt the Republic of Athens, or prevail
with it to sell its liberty and that of Greece!"</blockquote>

<p>In their private life the Athenians were courteous, generous,
and humane. Whilst bold and free in the expression of their
opinions, they paid the greatest attention to rules of politeness,
and were nicely delicate on points of decorum. They had a
natural sense of what was becoming and appropriate, and an
innate aversion to all extravagance. A graceful demeanor and
a quiet dignity were distinguishing traits of Athenian character.
They were temperate and frugal<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a>
<a href="#footnote34"><sup class="sml">34</sup></a> in their habits, and little addicted
to ostentation and display. Even after their victories had
brought them into contact with Oriental luxury and extravagance,
and their wealth enabled them to rival, in costliness and
splendor, the nations they had conquered, they still maintained
a republican simplicity. The private dwellings of the principal
citizens were small, and usually built of clay; their interior embellishments
also were insignificant--the house of Polytion alone
formed an exception.<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a>
<a href="#footnote35"><sup class="sml">35</sup></a> All their sumptuousness and magnificence
were reserved for and lavished on their public edifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="48">48</a></span>
and monuments of art, which made Athens the pride of Greece
and the wonder of the world. Intellectually, the Athenians
were remarkable for their quickness of apprehension, their nice
and delicate perception, their intuitional power, and their versatile
genius. Nor were they at all incapable of pursuing laborious
researches, or wanting in persevering application and industry,
notwithstanding Plutarch's assertion to the contrary.
The circumstances of every-day life in Attica, the conditions
which surrounded the Athenian from childhood to age, were
such as to call for the exercise of these qualities of mind in the
highest degree. Habits of patient industry were induced in
the Athenian character by the poverty and comparative barrenness
of the soil, demanding greater exertion to supply their
natural wants. And an annual period of dormancy, though unaccompanied
by the rigors of a northern winter, called for prudence
in husbanding, and forethought and skill in endeavoring
to increase their natural resources. The aspects of nature
were less massive and awe-inspiring, her features more subdued,
and her areas more circumscribed and broken, inviting and
emboldening man to attempt her conquest. The whole tendency
of natural phenomena in Greece was to restrain the imagination,
and discipline the observing and reasoning faculties
in man. Thus was man inspired with confidence in his own
resources, and allured to cherish an inquisitive, analytic, and
scientific spirit. "The French, in point of national character,
hold nearly the same relative place amongst the nations of Europe
that the Athenians held amongst the States of Ancient
Greece." And whilst it is admitted the French are quick,
sprightly, vivacious, perhaps sometimes light even to frivolity, it
must be conceded they have cultivated the natural and exact
sciences with a patience, and perseverance, and success unsurpassed
by any of the nations of Europe. And so the Athenians
were the Frenchmen of Greece. Whilst they spent their
"leisure time"<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a>
<a href="#footnote36"><sup class="sml">36</sup></a> in the place of public resort, the porticoes and
groves, "hearing and telling the latest news" (no undignified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="49" >49</a></span>
or improper mode of recreation in a city where newspapers
were unknown), whilst they are condemned as "garrulous,"
"frivolous," "full of curiosity," and "restlessly fond of novelties,"
we must insist that a love of study, of patient thought
and profound research, was congenial to their natural temperament,
and that an inquisitive and analytic spirit, as well as a
taste for subtile and abstract speculation, were inherent in the
national character. The affluence, and fullness, and flexibility,
and sculpture-like finish of the language of the Attics, which
leaves far behind not only the languages of antiquity, but also
the most cultivated of modern times, is an enduring monument
of the patient industry of the Athenians.<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a>
<a href="#footnote37"><sup class="sml">37</sup></a> Language is unquestionably
the highest creation of reason, and in the language
of a nation we can see reflected as in a mirror the amount of
culture to which it has attained. The rare balance of the imagination
and the reasoning powers, in which the perfection of
the human intellect is regarded as consisting, the exact correspondence
between the thought and the expression, "the free
music of prosaic numbers in the most diversified forms of style,"
the calmness, and perspicuity, and order, even in the stormiest
moments of inspiration, revealed in every department of Greek
literature, were not a mere happy stroke of chance, but a product
of unwearied effort--and effort too which was directed by
the criteria which reason supplied. The plastic art of Greece,
which after the lapse of ages still stands forth in unrivalled
beauty, so that, in presence of the eternal models it created,
the modern artist feels the painful lack of progress was not
a spontaneous outburst of genius, but the result of intense
application and unwearied discipline. The achievements of
the philosophic spirit, the ethical and political systems of the
Academy, the Lyceum, the Stoa, and the Garden, the anticipations,
scattered here and there like prophetic hints, of some of
the profoundest discoveries of "inductive science" in more
modern days,--all these are an enduring protest against the
strange misrepresentations of Plutarch.</p>

that no society of civilized men has been, or can be constituted without the
aid of a religion directly communicated by revelation, and transmitted by
oral tradition;--"that it is possible to raise a body of men into that degree
of civil improvement which would excite the passion for philosophic investigation,
without the aid of religion... can have no proof, and is contradicted

i. p. 271; see also Archbishop Whately, "Dissertation," etc., vol. i. <i>Encyc.
Brit.</i>, p. 449-455).

<p>The fallacy of the reasoning by which this doctrine is sought to be sustained
is found in the assumption "that to all our race the existence of a
First Cause is a question of philosophy," and that the idea of God lies at
the end of "a gradual process of inquiry" and induction, for which a high
degree of "scientific culture" is needed. Whereas the idea of a First Cause
lies at the beginning, not at the end of philosophy; and philosophy is simply
the analysis of our natural consciousness of God, and the presentation of
the idea in a logical form. Faith in the existence of God is not the result
of a conscious process of reflection; it is the spontaneous and instinctive
logic of the human mind, which, in view of phenomena presented to sense,
by a necessary law of thought immediately and intuitively affirms a personal
Power, an intelligent Mind as the author. In this regard, there is no difference
between men except the clearness with which they apprehend, and the
logical account they can render to themselves, of this instinctive belief.
Spontaneous intuition, says Cousin, is the genius of all men; reflection the
genius of few men. "But Leibnitz had no more confidence in the principle
of causality, and even in his favorite principle of sufficient reason, than the
most ignorant of men;" the latter have this principle within them, as a law
of thought, controlling their conception of the universe, and doing this almost
unconsciously; the former, by an analysis of thought, succeeded in defining
and formulating the ideas and laws which necessitate the cognition of
a God. The function of philosophy is simply to transform ἀληθὴς δόξα into
ίτιστήµη--right opinion into science,--to elucidate and logically present the
immanent thought which lies in the universal consciousness of man.</p>

<p>That the possession of the idea of God is essential to the social and moral
elevation of man,--that is, to the civilization of our race, is most cheerfully
conceded. That humanity has an end and destination which can only be
secured by the true knowledge of God, and by a participation of the nature
of God, is equally the doctrine of Plato and of Christ. Now, if humanity
has a special end and destination, it must have some instinctive tendings,
some spermatic ideas, some original forces or laws, which determine it towards
that end. All development supposes some original elements to be
unfolded or developed. Civilization is but the development of humanity according
to its primal idea and law, and under the best exterior conditions.
That the original elements of humanity were unfolded in some noble degree
under the influence of philosophy is clear from the history of Greece; there
the most favorable natural conditions for that development existed, and
Christianity alone was needed to crown the result with ideal perfection.</blockquote>

<p>Here the most perfect ideals of beauty and excellence in
physical development, in manners, in plastic art, in literary
creations, were realized. The songs of Homer, the dialogues
of Plato, the speeches of Demosthenes, and the statues of Phidias,
if not unrivalled, are at least unsurpassed by any thing that
has been achieved by their successors. Literature in its most
flourishing periods has rekindled its torch at her altars, and art
has looked back to the age of Pericles for her purest models.
Here the ideas of personal liberty, of individual rights, of freedom
in thought and action, had a wonderful expansion. Here
the lasting foundations of the principal arts and sciences were
laid, and in some of them triumphs were achieved which have
not been eclipsed. Here the sun of human reason attained a
meridian splendor, and illuminated every field in the domain
of moral truth. And here humanity reached the highest degree
of civilization of which it is capable under purely <i>natural</i> conditions.</p>

<p>And now, the question with which we are more immediately
concerned is, what were the specific and valuable results attained
by the Athenian mind in <i>religion</i> and <i>philosophy</i>, the two

fundamental momenta of thought and its development are spontaneity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="52" >52</a></span>
and reflection, and the two essential forms they assume
are religion and philosophy. In the natural order of thought
spontaneity is first, and reflection succeeds spontaneous thought.
And so religion is first developed, and subsequently comes philosophy.
As religion supposes spontaneous intuition, so philosophy
has religion for its basis, but upon this basis it is developed
in an original manner. "Turn your attention to history,
that living image of thought: everywhere you perceive religions
and philosophies: everywhere you see them produced in an invariable
order. Everywhere religion appears with new societies,
and everywhere, just so far as societies advance, from religion
springs philosophy."<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION.</h3>

<blockquote>
All things which I behold bear witness to your carefulness in religion
δεισιδαιµονεστέροις.--ST. PAUL.
</blockquote>

<p>As a prelude and preparation for the study of the religion
of the Athenians, it may be well to consider religion in its
more abstract and universal form; and inquire in what does
religion essentially consist; how far is it grounded in the nature
of man; and especially, what is there in the mental constitution
of man, or in his exterior conditions, which determines
him to a mode of life which may be denominated <i>religious?</i>
As a preliminary inquiry, this may materially aid us in understanding
the nature, and estimating the value of the religious
conceptions and sentiments which were developed by the Greek
mind.</p>

<p>Religion, in its most generic conception, may be defined as
a form of thought, feeling, and action, which has the <i>Divine</i> for
its object, basis, and end. Or, in other words, it is a mode of
life determined by the recognition of some relation to, and consciousness
of dependence upon, a <i>Supreme Being</i>. This general
conception of religion underlies all the specific forms of
religion which have appeared in the world, whether heathen,
Jewish, Mohammedan, or Christian.</p>

<p>That a religious destination appertains to man as man,
whether he has been raised to a full religious consciousness, or
is simply considered as capable of being so raised, can not be
denied. In all ages man has revealed an instinctive tendency,
or natural aptitude for religion, and he has developed feelings
and emotions which have always characterized him as a religious
being. Religious ideas and sentiments have prevailed
among all nations, and have exerted a powerful influence on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="54" >54</a></span>
the entire course of human history. Religious worship, addressed
to a Supreme Being believed to control the destiny of
man, has been coeval and coextensive with the race. Every
nation has had its mythology, and each mythologic system has
been simply an effort of humanity to realize and embody in
some visible form the relations in which it feels itself to be
connected with an external, overshadowing, and all-controlling
Power and Presence. The voice of all ancient, and all contemporaneous
history, clearly attests that the <i>religious principle</i>
is deeply seated in the nature of man; and that it has occupied
the thought, and stirred the feelings of every rational man, in
every age. It has interwoven itself with the entire framework
of human society, and ramified into all the relations of human
life. By its agency, nations have been revolutionized, and empires
have been overthrown; and it has formed a mighty element
in all the changes which have marked the history of man.</p>

<p>This universality of religious sentiment and religious worship
must be conceded as a fact of human nature, and, as a
universal fact, it demands an explanation. Every event must
have a cause. Every phenomenon must have its ground, and
reason, and law. The facts of religious history, the past and
present religious phenomena of the world can be no exception
to this fundamental principle; they press their imperious demand
to be studied and explained, as much as the phenomena
of the material or the events of the moral world. The phenomena
of religion, being universally revealed wherever man
is found, must be grounded in some universal principle, on
some original law, which is connate with, and natural to man.
At any rate, there must be something in the nature of man, or
in the exterior conditions of humanity, which invariably leads
man to worship, and which determines him, as by the force of
an original instinct, or an outward, conditioning necessity, to
recognize and bow down before a Superior Power. The full
recognition and adequate explanation of the facts of religious
history will constitute a <i>philosophy of religion</i>.</p>

<p>The hypotheses which have been offered in explanation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="55" >55</a></span>
the religious phenomena of the world are widely divergent, and
most of them are, in our judgment, eminently inadequate and
unsatisfactory. The following enumeration may be regarded
as embracing all that are deemed worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>I. The phenomenon of religion had its origin in SUPERSTITION,
that is, in a <i>fear</i> of invisible and supernatural powers,
generated by ignorance of nature.</p>

<p>II. The phenomenon of religion is part of that PROCESS or
EVOLUTION OF THE ABSOLUTE (i.e., the Deity), which gradually
unfolding itself in nature, mind, history, and <i>religion</i>, attains to
perfect self-consciousness in philosophy.</p>

<p>III. The phenomenon of religion has its foundation in FEELING--<i>the
feeling of dependence and of obligation</i>; and that to
which the mind, by spontaneous intuition or instinctive faith,
traces this dependence and obligation we call God.</p>

<p>IV. The phenomenon of religion had its outbirth in the
spontaneous apperceptions of REASON, that is, the necessary <i>à
priori ideas of the Infinite, the Perfect, the Unconditioned Cause,
the Eternal Being</i>, which are evoked into consciousness in presence
of the changeful and contingent phenomena of the world.</p>

<p>V. The phenomenon of religion had its origin in EXTERNAL
REVELATION, to which <i>reason</i> is related as a purely passive organ,
and <i>heathenism</i> as a feeble relic.</p>

<p>As a philosophy of religion--an attempt to supply the rationale
of the religious phenomena of the world, the first hypothesis
is a skeptical philosophy, which necessarily leads to
<i>Atheism</i>. The second is an idealistic philosophy (absolute
idealism), which inevitably lands in <i>Pantheism</i>. The third is
an intuitional or "faith-philosophy," which finally ends in <i>Mysticism</i>.
The fourth is a rationalistic or "spiritualistic" philosophy,
which yields pure <i>Theism</i>. The last is an empirical philosophy,
which derives all religion from instruction, and culminates
in <i>Dogmatic Theology</i>.</p>

<p>In view of these diverse and conflicting theories, the question
which now presents itself for our consideration is,--does
any one of these hypotheses meet and satisfy the demands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="56" >56</a></span>
the problem? does it fully account for and adequately explain
all the facts of religious history? The answer to this question
must not be hastily or dogmatically given. The arbitrary rejection
of any theory that may be offered, without a fair and
candid examination, will leave our minds in uncertainty and
doubt as to the validity of our own position. A blind faith is
only one remove from a pusillanimous skepticism. We can
not render our own position secure except by comprehending,
assaulting, and capturing the position of our foe. It is, therefore,
due to ourselves and to the cause of truth, that we shall
examine the evidence upon which each separate theory is based,
and the arguments which are marshalled in its support, before
we pronounce it inadequate and unphilosophical. Such
a criticism of opposite theories will prepare the way for the
presentation of a philosophy of religion which we flatter ourselves
will be found most in harmony with all the facts of the
case.</p>

<p>I. <i>It is affirmed that the religious phenomena of the world had
their origin in</i> SUPERSTITION, <i>that is, in a fear of unseen and supernatural
powers, generated from ignorance of nature</i>.</p>

<p>This explanation was first offered by Epicurus. He felt
that the universality of the religious sentiment is a fact which
demands a cause; and he found it, or presumed he found it
not in a spiritual God, which he claims can not exist, nor in
corporeal god which no one has seen, but in "phantoms of the
mind generated by fear." When man has been unable to explain
any natural phenomenon, to assign a cause within the
sphere of nature, he has had recourse to supernatural powers,
or living personalities behind nature, which move and control
nature in an arbitrary and capricious manner. These imaginary
powers are supposed to be continually interfering in the affairs
of individuals and nations. They bestow blessings or inflict
calamities. They reward virtue and punish vice. They
are, therefore, the objects of "sacred awe" and "superstitious
fear."</p>

<p>In order to rid men of all superstitious fear, and, consequently,
of all religion, Epicurus endeavors to show that "nature"
alone is adequate to the production of all things, and
there is no need to drag in a "divine power" to explain the
phenomena of the world.</p>

<p>This theory has been wrought into a somewhat plausible
form by the brilliant and imposing generalizations of Aug.
Comte. The religious phenomena of the world are simply one
stage in the necessary development of mind, whether in the individual
or the race. He claims to have been the first to discover
the great law of the three successive stages or phases of
human evolution. That law is thus enounced. Both in the
individual mind, and in the history of humanity, thought, in
dealing with its problems, passes, of necessity, through, first, a
<i>Theological</i>, second, a <i>Metaphysical</i>, and finally reaches a third,
or <i>Positive</i> stage.</p>

<p>In attempting an explanation of the universe, human
thought, in its earliest stages of development, resorts to the
idea of living personal agents enshrined in and moving every
object, whether organic or inorganic, natural or artificial. In
an advanced stage, it conceives a number of personal beings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="58" >58</a></span>
distinct from, and superior to nature, which preside over the
different provinces of nature--the sea, the air, the winds, the
rivers, the heavenly bodies, and assume the guardianship of individuals,
tribes, and nations. As a further, and still higher
stage, it asserts the unity of the Supreme Power which moves
and vitalizes the universe, and guides and governs in the affairs
of men and nations. The <i>Theological</i> stage is thus subdivided
into three epochs, and represented as commencing in <i>Fetichism</i>,
then advancing to <i>Polytheism</i>, and, finally, consummating in
<i>Monotheism</i>.</p>

<p>The next stage, the <i>Metaphysical</i>, is a transitional stage, in
which man substitutes abstract entities, as substance, force,
Being <i>in se</i>, the Infinite, the Absolute, in the place of theological
conceptions. During this period all theological opinions
undergo a process of disintegration, and lose their hold on
the mind of man. Metaphysical speculation is a powerful solvent,
which decomposes and dissipates theology.</p>

<p>It is only in the last--the <i>Positive</i> stage--that man becomes
willing to relinquish all theological ideas and metaphysical notions,
and confine his attention to the study of phenomena in
their relation to time and space; discarding all inquiries as to
causes, whether efficient or final, and denying the existence of
all entities and powers beyond nature.</p>

<p>The first stage, in its religious phase, is <i>Theistic</i>, the second
is <i>Pantheistic</i>, the last is <i>Atheistic</i>.</p>

<p>The proofs offered by Comte in support of this theory are
derived:</p>

<p>I. <i>From Cerebral Organization</i>. There are three grand divisions
of the Brain, the Medulla Oblongata, the Cerebellum,
and the Cerebrum; the first represents the merely animal instincts
the second, the more elevated sentiments, the third,
the intellectual powers. Human nature must, therefore, both
in the individual and in the race, be developed in the following
order: (1.) in animal instincts; (2.) in social affections and
communal tendencies; (3.) in intellectual pursuits. Infant life
is a merely animal existence, shared in common with the brute;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="59" >59</a></span>
in childhood the individual being realizes his relation to external
nature and human society; in youth and manhood he compares,
generalizes, and classifies the objects of knowledge, and
attains to science. And so the infancy of our race was a mere
animal or savage state, the childhood of our race the organization
of society, the youth and manhood of our race the development
of science.</p>

<p>Now, without offering any opinion as to the merits of the
phrenological theories of Gall and Spurzheim, we may ask,
what relation has this order to the law of development presented
by Comte? Is there any imaginable connection between
animal propensities and theological ideas; between social affections
and metaphysical speculations? Are not the intellectual
powers as much concerned with theological ideas and metaphysical
speculations as with positive science? And is it not
more probable, more in accordance with facts, that all the powers
of the mind, instinct, feeling, and thought, enter into action
simultaneously, and condition each other? The very first act
of perception, the first distinct cognition of an object, involves
<i>thought</i> as much as the last generalization of science. We
know nothing of <i>mind</i> except as the development of thought,
and the first unfolding, even of the infant mind, reveals an intellectual
act, a discrimination between a self and an object
which is not self, and a recognition of resemblance, or difference
between <i>this</i> object and <i>that</i>. And what does Positive
science, in its most mature and perfect form, claim to do more
than "to study actual phenomena in their orders of resemblance,
coexistence, and succession."</p>

<p>Cerebral organization may furnish plausible analogies in favor
of some theory of human development, but certainly not
the one proposed by Aug. Comte. The attempt, however, to
construct a chart of human history on such an <i>à priori</i> method,--to
construct an ideal framework into which human nature
must necessarily grow, is a violation of the first and most
fundamental principle of the Positive science, which demands
that we shall confine ourselves strictly to the study of actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="60" >60</a></span>
phenomena in their orders of resemblance, coexistence, and
succession. The history of the human race must be based on
facts, not on hypotheses, and the facts must be ascertained by
the study of ancient records and existing monuments of the
past. Mere plausible analogies and <i>à priori</i> theories based
upon them, are only fitted to mislead the mind; they insert a
prism between the perceiving mind and the course of events
which decomposes the pure white light of fact, and throws a
false light over the entire field of history.</p>

<p>2. <i>The second order of proof is attempted to be drawn from the
analogies of individual experience</i>.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the history of the race is the same as that
of each individual mind; and it is affirmed that man is <i>religious</i>
in infancy, <i>metaphysical</i> in youth, and <i>positive</i>, that is, scientific
without being religious, in mature manhood; the history of the
race must therefore have followed the same order.</p>

<p>We are under no necessity of denying that there is some
analogy between the development of mind in the individual
man, and in humanity as a whole, in order to refute the theory
of Comte. Still, it must not be overlooked that the development
of mind, in all cases and in all ages, is materially affected
by exterior conditions. The influence of geographical and climatic
conditions, of social and national institutions, and especially
of education, however difficult to be estimated, can not be
utterly disregarded. And whether all these influences have
not been controlled, and collocated, and adjusted by a Supreme
Mind in the education of humanity, is also a question which
can not be pushed aside as of no consequence. Now, unless it
can be shown that the same outward conditions which have accompanied
the individual and modified his mental development,
have been repealed in the history of the race, and repeated in
the same order of succession, the argument has no value.</p>

<p>But, even supposing it could be shown that the development
of mind in humanity has followed the same order as that of the
individual, we confidently affirm that Comte has not given the
true history of the development of the individual mind. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="61" >61</a></span>
account he has given may perhaps be the history of his own
mental progress, but it certainly is not the history of every individual
mind, nor indeed, of a majority even, of educated
minds that have arrived at maturity. It would be much more
in harmony with facts to say childhood is the period of pure
receptivity, youth of doubt and skepticism, and maturity of well-grounded
and rational belief. In the ripeness and maturity of
the nineteenth century the number of scientific men of the
Comtean model is exceedingly small compared with the number
of religious men. There are minds in every part of Europe
and America as thoroughly scientific as that of Comte, and as
deeply imbued with the spirit of the Inductive Philosophy, which
are not conscious of any discordance between the facts of science
and the fundamental principles of theology. It may be
that, in his own immediate circle at Paris there may be a tendency
to Atheism, but certainly no such tendency exists in the
most scientific minds of Europe and America. The faith of Bacon,
and Newton, and Boyle, of Descartes, Leibnitz, and Pascal,
in regard to the fundamental principles of theology, is still the
faith of Sedgwick, Whewell, Herschel, Brewster, Owen, Agassiz,
Silliman, Mitchell, Hitchcock, Dana, and, indeed of the leading
scientific minds of the world--the men who, as Comte
would say, "belong to the élite of humanity." The mature
mind, whether of the individual or the race, is not Atheistical.</p>

<p>3. <i>The third proof is drawn from a survey of the history of certain
portions of our race.</i></p>

<p>Comte is far from being assured that the progress of humanity,
under the operation of his grand law of development,
has been uniform and invariable. The majority of the human
race, the vast populations of India, China, and Japan, have remained
stationary; they are still in the Theological stage, and
consequently furnish no evidence in support of his theory. For
this reason he confines himself to the "élite" or advance-guard
of humanity, and in this way makes the history of humanity a
very "abstract history" indeed. Starting with Greece as the
representative of ancient civilization, passing thence to Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="62" >62</a></span>
civilization, and onward to Western Europe, he attempts to
show that the actual progress of humanity has been, on the
whole, in conformity with his law. To secure, however, even
this semblance of harmony between the facts of history and his
hypothetical law, he has to treat the facts very much as Procrustes
treated his victims,--he must stretch some, and mutilate
others, so as to make their forms fit the iron bed. The
natural organization of European civilization is distorted and
torn asunder. "As the third or positive stage had accomplished
its advent in his own person, it was necessary to find
the metaphysical period just before; and so the whole life of
the Reformed Christianity, in embryo and in manifest existence,
is stripped of its garb of <i>faith</i>, and turned out of view as
a naked metaphysical phenomenon. But metaphysics, again,
have to be ushered in by theology; and of the three stages of
theology Monotheism is the last, necessarily following on Polytheism,
as that, again, on Fetichism. There is nothing for it,
therefore, but to let the mediæval Catholic Christianity stand
as the world's first monotheism, and to treat it as the legitimate
offspring and necessary development of the Greek and Roman
polytheism. This, accordingly, Comte actually does. Protestantism
he illegitimates, and outlaws from religion altogether,
and the genuine Christianity he fathers upon the faith of Homer
and the Scipios! Once or twice, indeed, it seems to cross
him that there was such a people as the Hebrews, and that
they were not the polytheists they ought to have been. He
sees the fact, but pushes it out of his way with the remark that
the Jewish monotheism was 'premature.'"<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a>

<p>The signal defect of Comte's historical survey, however, is,
that it furnishes no evidence of the general prevalence of Fetichism
in primitive times. The writings of Moses are certainly
entitled to as much consideration and credence as the writings
of Berosus, Manetho, and Herodotus; and, it will not be denied,
they teach that the faith of the earliest families and races of
men was <i>monotheistic</i>. The early Vedas, the Institutes of Menu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="63" >63</a></span>
the writings of Confucius, the Zendavesta, all bear testimony
that the ancient faith of India, China, and Persia, was, at any
rate, pantheistic; and learned and trustworthy critics, Asiatic
as well as European, confidently affirm that the ground of the
Brahminical, Buddhist, and Parsist faith is <i>monotheistic</i>; and
that <i>one</i> Being is assumed, in the earliest books, to be the
origin of all things.<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a>
<a href="#footnote43"><sup class="sml">43</sup></a> Without evidence, Comte assumes that
the savage state is the original condition of man; and instead
of going to Asia, the cradle of the race, for some light as to the
early condition and opinions of the remotest families of men,
he turns to Africa, the <i>soudan</i> of the earth, for his illustration
of the habit of man, in the infancy of our race, to endow every
object in nature, whether organic or inorganic, with life and intelligence.
The theory of a primitive state of ignorance and
barbarism is a mere assumption--an hypothesis in conflict with
the traditionary legends of all nations, the earliest records of
our race, and the unanimous voice of antiquity, which attest the
general belief in a primitive state of light and innocence.</p>

<p>The three stages of development which Comte describes as
necessarily successive, have, for centuries past, been simultaneous.
The theological, the metaphysical, and the scientific elements
coexist now, and there is no real, radical, or necessary
conflict between them. Theological and metaphysical ideas
hold their ground as securely under the influence of enlarged
scientific discovery as before; and there is no reason to suppose
they ever had more power over the mind of man than they
have to-day. The notion that God is dethroned by the wonderful
discoveries of modern science, and theology is dead, is the
dream of the "<i>profond orage cérébral</i>" which interrupted the
course of Comte's lectures in 1826. As easily may the hand
of Positivism arrest the course of the sun, as prevent the instinctive
thought of human reason recognizing and affirming
the existence of a God. And so long as ever the human mind
is governed by necessary laws of thought, so long will it seek...</p>

<p>....eur, and consequently to develop its true philosophy. Its fundamental
error is the assumption that all our knowledge is confined
to the observation and classification of sensible phenomena--that
is, to changes perceptible by the senses. Psychology,
based, as it is, upon self-observation and self-reflection, is a
"mere illusion; and logic and ethics, so far as they are built
upon it as their foundation, are altogether baseless." Spiritual
entities, forces, causes, efficient or final, are unknown and unknowable;
all inquiry regarding them must be inhibited, "for
Theology is inevitable if we permit the inquiry into causes at
all."</p>

<p>II. The second hypothesis offered in explanation of the facts
of religious history is, <i>that religion is part of that</i> PROCESS OR EVOLUTION
OF THE ABSOLUTE (<i>i.e.</i>, the Deity) <i>which, gradually unfolding
itself in nature, mind, history, and religion, attains to the
fullest self-consciousness in philosophy</i>.</p>

<p>This is the theory of Hegel, in whose system of philosophy
the subjective idealism of Kant culminates in the doctrine of
"<i>Absolute Identity</i>." Its fundamental position is that thought
and being, subject and object, the perceiving mind and the
thing perceived, are ultimately and essentially <i>one</i>, and that the
only actual reality is that which results from their mutual relation.
The outward thing is nothing, the inward perception is
nothing, for neither could exist alone; the only reality is the
relation, or rather synthesis of the two; the essence or nature
of being in itself accordingly consists in the coexistence of two
contrarieties. Ideas, arising from the union or synthesis of two
opposites, are therefore the <i>concrete realities</i> of Hegel; and the
<i>process</i> of the evolution of ideas, in the human mind, is the process
of all existence--<i>the Absolute Idea</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Absolute</i>(die Idée) thus forms the beginning, middle, and
end of the system of Hegel. It is the one infinite existence or
thought, of which nature, mind, history, religion, and philosophy,
are the manifestation. "The absolute is, with him, not the
infinite <i>substance</i>, as with Spinoza; nor the infinite <i>subject</i>, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="66">66</a></span>
with Fichte; nor the infinite <i>mind</i>, as with Schelling; it is a
perpetual <i>process</i>, an eternal thinking, without beginning and
without end."<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a>
<a href="#footnote44"><sup class="sml">44</sup></a> This <i>living, eternal process of absolute existence
is the God of Hegel</i>.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the <i>Absolute</i> is, with Hegel, the sum
of all actual and possible existence; "nothing is true and real
except so far as it forms an element of the Absolute Spirit."<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a>
<a href="#footnote45"><sup class="sml">45</sup></a>
"What kind of an Absolute Being," he asks, "is that which
does not contain in itself all that is actual, even evil included?"<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a>
<a href="#footnote46"><sup class="sml">46</sup></a>
The Absolute, therefore, in Hegel's conception, does not allow
of any existence out of itself. It is the <i>unity</i> of the finite and
the infinite, the eternal and the temporal, the ideal and the real,
the subject and the object. And it is not only the unity of
these opposites so as to exclude all difference, but it contains
in itself, all the differences and opposites as elements of its being;
otherwise the distinctions would stand over against
absolute as a limit, and the absolute would cease to be absolute.</p>

<p>God is, therefore, according to Hegel, "no motionless, eternally
self-identical and unchangeable being, but a living, eternal
<i>process</i> of absolute self-existence. This process consists in the
eternal self-distinction, or antithesis, and equally self-reconciliation
or synthesis of those opposites which enter, as necessary
elements, into the constitution of the Divine Being. This <i>self-evolution</i>,
whereby the absolute enters into antithesis, and returns
to itself again, is the eternal <i>self-actualization</i> of its being,
and which at once constitutes the beginning, middle, and
end, as in the circle, where the beginning is at the same time the
end, and the end the beginning."<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a>

<p>The whole philosophy of Hegel consists in the development
of this idea of God by means of his, so-called, dialectic method,
which reflects the objective life-process of the Absolute, and is,
in fact, identical with it; for God, says he, "is only the Absolute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="67" >67</a></span>
Intelligence in so far as he knows himself to be the Absolute
Intelligence, <i>and this he knows only in science</i> [dialectics],
<i>and this knowledge alone constitutes his true existence.</i>"<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a>
<a href="#footnote48"><sup class="sml">48</sup></a> This
life-process of the Absolute has three "moments." It may be
considered as the idea <i>in itself</i>--bare, naked, undetermined, unconscious
idea; as the idea <i>out of itself</i>, in its objective form,
or in its differentiation; and, finally, as the idea <i>in itself</i>, and <i>for
itself</i>, in its regressive or reflective form. This movement of
thought gives, <i>first</i>, bare, naked, indeterminate thought, or
thought in the mere antithesis of Being and non-Being; <i>secondly</i>,
thought externalizing itself in nature; and, <i>thirdly</i>, thought
returning to itself, and knowing itself in mind, or consciousness.
Philosophy has, accordingly, three corresponding divisions:--1.
LOGIC, which here is identical with metaphysics; 2. PHILOSOPHY
OF NATURE; 3. PHILOSOPHY OF MIND.</p>

<p>It is beyond our design to present an expanded view of the
entire philosophy of Hegel. But as he has given to the world
a <i>new</i> logic, it may be needful to glance at its general features
as a help to the comprehension of his philosophy of religion.
The fundamental law of his logic is the <i>identity of contraries or
contradictions</i>. All thought is a synthesis of contraries or opposites.
This antithesis not only exists in all ideas, but constitutes
them. In every idea we form, there must be <i>two</i> things
opposed and distinguished, in order to afford a clear conception.
Light can not be conceived but as the opposite of darkness;
good can not be thought except in opposition to evil.
All life, all reality is thus, essentially, the union of two elements,
which, together, are mutually opposed to, and yet imply each
other.</p>

<p>The identity of Being and Nothing is one of the consequences
of this law.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Absolute is the Being</i> (das Absolute ist das Seyn), and
"the Being" is here, according to Hegel, bare, naked, abstract,
undistinguished, indeterminate, unconscious idea.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Absolute is the Nothing</i> (das Absolute ist das Nichts).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="68">68</a></span>
"Pure being is pure abstraction, and consequently the absolute-negative,
which in like manner, directly taken, is <i>nothing</i>."
Being and Nothing are the positive and negative poles of the
Idea, that is, the Absolute. They both alike exist, they are
both pure abstractions, both absolutely unconditioned, without
attributes, and without consciousness. Hence follows the conclusion--</p>

<p>3. <i>Being and Nothing are identical</i> (das Seyn und das Nichts
ist dasselbe), Being is non-Being. Non-Being <i>is</i> Being--the
Anders-seyn--which becomes <i>as</i> Being to the Seyn. Nothing is,
in some sense, an actual thing.</p>

<p><i>Being</i> and <i>Nothing</i> are thus the two elements which enter
into the one Absolute Idea as contradictories, and both together
combine to form a complete notion of bare production, or
the <i>becoming</i> of something out of nothing,--the unfolding of real
existence in its lowest form, that is, of <i>nature</i>.</p>

<p>The "<i>Philosophy of Nature</i>" exhibits a series of necessary
movements which carry the idea forward in the ascending scale
of sensible existence. The laws of mechanics, chemistry, and
physiology are resolved into a series of oppositions. But the
law which governs this development requires the self-reconciliation
of these opposites. The idea, therefore, which in nature
was unconscious and ignorant of itself, returns upon itself, and
becomes conscious of itself, that is, becomes <i>mind</i>. The science
of the regression or self-reflection of the idea, is the "<i>Philosophy
of Mind</i>."</p>

<p>The "<i>Philosophy of Mind</i>" is subdivided by Hegel into
three parts. There is, first, the subjective or individual mind
(<i>psychology</i>); then the objective or universal mind, as represented
in society, the state, and in history (<i>ethics, political philosophy,</i>
or <i>jurisprudence</i>, and <i>philosophy of history</i>); and, finally, the
union of the subjective and objective mind, or <i>the absolute mind</i>.
This last manifests itself again under three forms, representing
the three degrees of the self-consciousness of the Spirit, as the
eternal truth. These are, first, <i>art</i>, or the representation of
beauty (æsthetics); secondly, <i>religion</i>, in the general acceptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="69" >69</a></span>
of the term (philosophy of religion); and, thirdly, <i>philosophy</i> itself,
as the purest and most perfect form of the scientific knowledge
of truth. All historical religions, the Oriental, the Jewish,
the Greek, the Roman, and the Christian, are <i>the successive
stages in the development or self-actualization of God</i>.<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a>
<a href="#footnote49"><sup class="sml">49</sup></a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to indicate to the reader that the philosophy
of Hegel is essentially pantheistic. "God is not a <i>person</i>,
but personality itself, <i>i.e.</i>, the universal personality, which realizes
itself in every human consciousness, as so many separate
thoughts of one eternal mind. The idea we form of the absolute
is, to Hegel, the absolute itself, its essential existence being
identical with our conception of it. Apart from, and out
of the world, there is no God; and so also, apart from the universal
consciousness of man, there is no Divine consciousness
or personality."<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a>

<p>This whole conception of religion, however, is false, and conflicts
with the actual facts of man's religious nature and religious
history. If the word "religion" has any meaning at all,
it is "a mode of life determined by the consciousness of dependence
upon, and obligation to God." It is reverence for,
gratitude to, and worship of God as a being distinct from humanity.
But in the philosophy of Hegel religion is a part of
God--a stage in the development or self-actualization of God.
Viewed under one aspect, religion is the self-adoration of God--the
worship of God by God; under another aspect it is the
worship of humanity, since God only becomes conscious of
himself in humanity. The fundamental fallacy is that upon
which his entire method proceeds, viz., "the identity of subject
and object, being and thought." Against this false position the
consciousness of each individual man, and the universal consciousness
of our race, as revealed in history, alike protest. If
thought and being are identical, then whatever is true of ideas
is also true of objects, and then, as Kant had before remarked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="70" >70</a></span>
there is no difference between <i>thinking</i> we possess a hundred
dollars, and actually <i>possessing</i> them. Such absurdities may be
rendered plausible by a logic which asserts the "identity of
contradictions," but against such logic common sense rebels.
"The law of non-contradiction" has been accepted by all logicians,
from the days of Aristotle, as a fundamental law of
thought. "Whatever is contradictory is unthinkable. A=not
A=O, or A--A=O."<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a>

<p>III. The third hypothesis affirms <i>that the phenomenon of religion
has its foundation in</i> FEELING--<i>the feeling of dependence and
of obligation</i>; and that to which the mind, by spontaneous intuition
of instinctive faith, traces that dependence and obligation
we call God.</p>

<p>This, with some slight modification in each case, consequent
upon the differences in their philosophic systems, is the theory
of Jacobi, Schleiermacher, Nitzsch, Mansel, and probably Hamilton.
Its fundamental position is, that we can not gain truth
with absolute certainty either from sense or reason, and, consequently,
the only valid source of real knowledge is <i>feeling--faith,
intuition</i>, or, as it is called by some, <i>inspiration</i>.</p>

<p>There have been those, in all ages, who have made all
knowledge of invisible, supersensuous, divine things, to rest
upon an internal <i>feeling</i>, or immediate, inward vision. The
Oriental Mystics, the Neo-Platonists, the Mystics of the Greek
and Latin Church, the German Mystics of the 14th century, the
Theosophists of the Reformation, the Quietists of France, the
Quakers, have all appealed to some <i>special</i> faculty, distinct
from the understanding and reason, for the immediate cognition
of invisible and spiritual existences. By some, that
special faculty was regarded as an "interior eye" which was
illuminated by the "Universal Light;" by others, as a peculiar
sensibility of the soul--a <i>feeling</i> in whose perfect calm and utter
quiescence the Divinity was mirrored; or which, in an ecstatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="71" >71</a></span>
state, rose to a communion with, and final absorption in
the Infinite.</p>

<p>Jacobi was the first, in modern times, to give the "faith-philosophy,"
as it is now designated, a definite form. He assumes
the position that all knowledge, of whatever kind, must
ultimately rest upon intuition or faith. As it regards sensible
objects, the understanding finds the impression from which all
our knowledge of the external flows, ready formed. The process
of sensation is a mystery; we know nothing of it until it is
past, and the feeling it produces is present. Our knowledge of
matter, therefore, rests upon faith in these intuitions. We can
not doubt that the feeling has an objective cause. In every act
of perception there is something actual and present, which can
not be referred to a mere subjective law of thought. We are
also conscious of another class of feelings which correlate us
with a supersensuous world, and these feelings, also, must have
their cause in some objective reality. Just as sensation gives
us an immediate knowledge of an external world, so there is an
internal sense which gives us an immediate knowledge of a spiritual
world--God, the soul, freedom, immortality. Our knowledge
of the invisible world, like our knowledge of the visible
world, is grounded upon faith in our intuitions. All philosophic
knowledge is thus based upon <i>belief</i>, which Jacobi regards as
a fact of our inward sensibility--a sort of knowledge produced
by an immediate <i>feeling</i> of the soul--a direct apprehension,
without proof, of the True, the Supersensuous, the Eternal.</p>

<p>Jacobi prepared the way for, and was soon eclipsed by the
deservedly greater name of Schleiermacher. His fundamental
position was that truth in Theology could not be obtained by reason,
but by a feeling, <i>insight</i>, or intuition, which in its lowest form
he called <i>God-consciousness</i>, and in its highest form,
<i>Christian-consciousness.</i> The God-consciousness, in its original form, is
the <i>feeling of dependence</i> on the Infinite. The Christian consciousness
is the perfect union of the human consciousness with
the Divine, through the mediation of Christ, or what we would
call a Christian experience of communion with God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="72">72</a></span></p>

<p>Rightly to understand the position of Schleiermacher we
must take account of his doctrine of <i>self</i>-consciousness. "In
all self-consciousness," says he, "there are two elements, a Being
ein Seyn, and a Somehow-having-become (Irgendweigewordenseyn).
The last, however, presupposes, for every self-consciousness,
besides the ego, yet something else from whence
the certainty of the same [self-consciousness] exists, and without
which self-consciousness would not be just this."<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a>
<a href="#footnote52"><sup class="sml">52</sup></a> Every
determinate mode of the sensibility supposes an <i>object</i>, and a <i>relation</i>
between the subject and the object, the subjective feeling
deriving its determinations from the object. External sensation,
the feeling, say of extension and resistance, gives world-consciousness.
Internal sensation, the <i>feeling of dependence</i>,
gives God consciousness. And it is only by the presence of
world consciousness and God-consciousness that self consciousness
can be what it is.</p>

<p>We have, then, in our self-consciousness a <i>feeling of direct dependence</i>,
and that to which our minds instinctively trace that
dependence we call God. "By means of the religious feeling,
the Primal Cause is revealed in us, as in perception, the things
external, are revealed in us."<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a>
<a href="#footnote53"><sup class="sml">53</sup></a> The <i>felt</i>, therefore, is not only
the first religious sense, but the ruling, abiding, and perfect form
of the religious spirit; whatever lays any claim to religion must
maintain its ground and principle in <i>feeling</i>, upon which it depends
for its development; and the sum-total of the forces constituting
religious life, inasmuch as it is a <i>life</i>, is based upon
immediate self-consciousness.<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a>

<p>The doctrine of Schleiermacher is somewhat modified by
Mansel, in his "<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i>." He maintains,
with Schleiermacher, that religion is grounded in <i>feeling</i>, and
that the <i>felt</i> is the first intimation or presentiment of the Divine.
Man "<i>feels</i> within him the consciousness of a Supreme
Being, and the instinct to worship, before he can argue from
effects to causes, or estimate the traces of wisdom and benevolence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="73" >73</a></span>
scattered through the creation."<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a>
<a href="#footnote55"><sup class="sml">55</sup></a> He also agrees with
Schleiermacher in regarding the <i>feeling of dependence</i> as <i>a</i> state
of the sensibility, out of which reflection builds up the edifice
of Religious Consciousness, but he does not, with Schleiermacher,
regard it as pre-eminently <i>the</i> basis of religious consciousness.
"The mere consciousness of dependence does
not, of itself, exhibit the character of the Being on whom we
depend. It is as consistent with superstition as with religion;
with the belief in a malevolent, as in a benevolent Deity."<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a>
<a href="#footnote56"><sup class="sml">56</sup></a>
To the feeling of dependence he has added the <i>consciousness
of moral obligation</i>, which he imagines supplies the deficiency.
By this consciousness of moral obligation "we are compelled
to assume the existence of a moral Deity, and to regard the
absolute standard of right and wrong as constituted by the
nature of that Deity."<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a>
<a href="#footnote57"><sup class="sml">57</sup></a> "To these two facts of the inner consciousness
the feeling of dependence, and consciousness of
moral obligation may be traced, as to their sources, the two
great outward acts by which religion, in its various forms, has
been manifested among men--<i>Prayer</i>, by which they seek to
win God's blessing upon the future, and <i>Expiation</i>, by which
they strive to atone for the offenses of the past. The feeling
of dependence is the instinct which urges us to pray. It is the
feeling that our existence and welfare are in the hands of a superior
power; not an inexorable fate, not an immutable law;
but a Being having at least so far the attribute of personality
that he can show favor or severity to those who are dependent
upon Him, and can be regarded by them with feelings of hope
and fear, and reverence and gratitude."<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a>
<a href="#footnote58"><sup class="sml">58</sup></a> The feeling of moral
obligation--"the law written in the heart"--leads man to recognize
a Lawgiver. "Man can be a law unto himself only on
the supposition that he reflects in himself the law of God."<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag549"></a>
<a href="#footnote59"><sup class="sml">59</sup></a>
The conclusion from the whole is, there must be an <i>object</i> answering
to this consciousness: there must be a God to explain
these facts of the soul.</p>

<p>This "philosophy of feeling," or of faith generated by feeling,
has an interest and a significance which has not been adequately
recognized by writers on natural theology. Feeling,
sentiment, enthusiasm, have always played an important part in
the history of religion. Indeed it must be conceded that religion
is a <i>right state of feeling towards God</i>--religion is <i>piety</i>. A philosophy
of the religious emotion is, therefore, demanded in order
to the full interpretation of the religious phenomena of the world.</p>

<p>But the notion that internal feeling, a peculiar determination
of the sensibility, is the source of religious ideas:--that God
can be known immediately by feeling without the mediation of
the truth that manifests God; that he can be <i>felt</i> as the qualities
of matter can be felt; and that this affection of the inward
sense can reveal the character and perfections of God, is an
unphilosophical and groundless assumption. To assert, with
Nitzsch, that "feeling has reason, and is reason, and that the
sensible and felt God-consciousness generates out of itself fundamental
conceptions," is to confound the most fundamental
psychological distinctions, and arbitrarily bend the recognized
classifications of mental science to the necessities of a theory.
Indeed, we are informed that it is "by means of an <i>independent</i>
psychology, and conformably to it," that Schleiermacher illustrates
his "philosophy of feeling."<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a>
<a href="#footnote60"><sup class="sml">60</sup></a> But all psychology must
be based upon the observation and classification of mental
phenomena, as revealed in consciousness, and not constructed
in an "independent" and à priori method. The most careful
psychological analysis has resolved the whole complex phenomena
of mind into thought, feeling, and volition.<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a>
<a href="#footnote61"><sup class="sml">61</sup></a> These orders
of phenomena are radically and essentially distinct. They differ
not simply in degree but in kind, and it is only by an utter
disregard of the facts of consciousness that they can be confounded.
Feeling is not reason, nor can it by any logical dexterity
be transformed into reason.</p>

<p>The question as to the relative order of cognition and feeling,
that is, as to whether feeling is the first or original form of
the religious consciousness, or whether feeling be not consequent
upon some idea or cognition of God, is one which can
not be determined on empirical grounds. We are precluded
from all scrutiny of the incipient stages of mental development
in the individual mind and in collective humanity. If we attempt
to trace the early history of the soul, its beginnings are
lost in a period of blank unconsciousness, beyond all scrutiny
of memory or imagination. If we attempt the inquiry on the
wider field of universal consciousness, the first unfoldings of
mind in humanity are lost in the border-land of mystery, of
which history furnishes no authentic records. All dogmatic affirmation
must, therefore, be unjustifiable. The assertion that
religious feeling precedes all cognition,--that "the consciousness
of dependence on a Supreme Being, and the instinct of
worship" are developed <i>first</i> in the mind, before the reason is
exercised, is utterly groundless. The more probable doctrine
is that all the primary faculties enter into spontaneous action
<i>simultaneously</i>--the reason with the senses, the feelings with
the reason, the judgment with both the senses and the reason,
and that from their primary and simultaneous action arises
the complex result, called consciousness, or conjoint knowledge.<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a>
<a href="#footnote62"><sup class="sml">62</sup></a>
There can be no clear and distinct consciousness without
the cognition of a <i>self</i> and a <i>not-self</i> in mutual relation and
opposition. Now the knowledge of the self--the personal ego--is
an intuition of reason; the knowledge of the not-self is an
intuition of sense. All knowledge is possible only under condition
of plurality, difference, and relation.<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a>
<a href="#footnote63"><sup class="sml">63</sup></a> Now the judgment
is "the Faculty of Relations," or of comparison; and the affirmation
"<i>this</i> is not <i>that</i>" is an act of judgment; to know is,
consequently, to judge.<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a>
<a href="#footnote64"><sup class="sml">64</sup></a> Self-consciousness must, therefore, be
regarded as a synthesis of sense, reason, and judgment, and
not a mere self-feeling (cœnæsthesis).</p>

<p>A profound analysis will further lead to the conclusion that
if ideas of reason are not chronologically antecedent to sensation,
they are, at least, the logical antecedents of all cognition.
The mere feeling of resistance can not give the notion of
without the à priori idea of space. The feeling of movement
of change, can not give the cognition of event without the rational
idea of time or duration. Simple consciousness can not
generate the idea of personality, or selfhood, without the rational
idea of identity or unity. And so the mere "feeling of dependence,"
of finiteness and imperfection, can not give the idea
of God, without the rational à priori idea of the Infinite, the
Perfect, the Unconditioned Cause. Sensation is not knowledge,
and never can become knowledge, without the intervention
of reason, and a concentrated self feeling can not rise essentially
above animal life until it has, through the mediation
of reason, attained the idea of the existence of a Supreme Being
ruling over nature and man.</p>

<p>Mere feeling is essentially blind. In its <i>pathological</i> form, it
may indicate a want, and even develop an unconscious appetency,
but it can not, itself, reveal an <i>object</i>, any more than the
feeling of hunger can reveal the actual presence, or determine the
character and fitness, of any food. An undefinable fear, a mysterious
presentiment, an instinctive yearning, a hunger of the
soul, these are all irrational emotions which can never rise to
the dignity of knowledge. An object must be conjured by the
imagination, or conceived by the understanding, or intuitively
apprehended by the reason, before the feeling can have any
significance.</p>

<p>Regarded in its <i>moral</i> form, as "the feeling of obligation," it
can have no real meaning unless a "law of duty" be known
and recognized. Feeling, alone, can not reveal what duty
is. When that which is right, and just, and good is revealed
to the mind, then the sense of obligation may urge man to
the performance of duty. But the right, the just, the good,
are ideas which are apprehended by the reason, and, consequently,
our moral sentiments are the result of the harmonious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="77" >77</a></span>
and living relation between the reason and the sensibilities.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansel asserts the inadequacy of Schleiermacher's
"feeling of dependence" to reveal the character of the Being
on whom we depend. He has therefore supplemented his doctrine
by the "feeling of moral obligation," which he thinks
"compels us to <i>assume</i> the existence of a moral Deity." We
think his "fact of religious intuition" is as inadequate as
Schleiermacher's to explain the whole phenomena of religion.
In neither instance does feeling supply the actual knowledge
of God. The feeling of dependence may indicate that there is
a Power or Being upon whom we depend for existence and
well-being, and which Power or Being "we call God." The
feeling of obligation certainly indicates the existence of a Being
to whom we are accountable, and which Being Mr. Mansel
calls a "moral Deity." But in both instances the character,
and even the existence of God is "<i>assumed</i>" and we are entitled
to ask on what ground it is assumed. It will not be asserted
that feeling alone generates the idea, or that the feeling
is transformed into idea without the intervention of thought
and reflection. Is there, then, a <i>logical</i> connection between the
feeling of dependence and of obligation, and the idea of the
Uncreated Mind, the Infinite First Cause, the Righteous Governor
of the world. Or is there a fixed and changeless co-relation
between <i>the feeling</i> and the <i>idea</i>, so that when the feeling
is present, the idea also necessarily arises in the mind? This
latter opinion seems to be the doctrine of Mansel. We accept
it as the statement of a fact of consciousness, but we can not
regard it as an account of the genesis of the idea of God in
the human mind. The idea of God as the First Cause, the Infinite
Mind, the Perfect Being, the personal Lord and Lawgiver,
the creator, sustainer, and ruler of the world, is not a
simple, primitive intuition of the mind. It is manifestly a complex,
concrete idea, and, as such, can not be developed in consciousness,
by the operation of a single faculty of the mind, in
a simple, undivided act. It originates in the spontaneous operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="78">78</a></span>
of the whole mind. It is a necessary deduction from
the facts of the universe, and the primitive intuitions of the reason,--a
logical inference from the facts of sense, consciousness,
and reason. A philosophy of religion which regards the feelings
as supreme, and which brands the decisions of reason as
uncertain, and well-nigh valueless, necessarily degenerates into
mysticism--a mysticism "which pretends to elevate man directly
to God, and does not see that, in depriving reason of its
power, it really deprives man of that which enables him to know
God, and puts him in a just communication with God by the intermediary
of eternal and infinite truth."<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a>

<p>The religious sentiments in all minds, and in all ages, have
resulted from the union of <i>thought</i> and <i>feeling</i>--the living and
harmonious relation of reason and sensibility; and a philosophy
which disregards either is inadequate to the explanation of
the phenomena.</p>

<p>IV. The fourth hypothesis is, <i>that religion has had its outbirth
in the spontaneous apperceptions of</i> REASON; that is, in the
necessary, à priori ideas of the infinite, the perfect, the unconditioned
Cause, the Eternal Being, which are evoked into consciousness
in presence of the changeful, contingent phenomena
of the world.</p>

<p>This will at once be recognized by the intelligent reader as
the doctrine of Cousin, by whom <i>pure reason</i> is regarded as the
grand faculty or organ of religion.</p>

<p>Religion, in the estimation of Cousin, is grounded on <i>cognition</i>
rather than upon feeling. It is the knowledge of God, and the
knowledge of duty in its relation to God and to human happiness;
and as reason is the general faculty of all knowing, it must
be the faculty of religion. "In its most elevated point of view,
religion is the relation of absolute truth to absolute Being," and
as absolute truth is apprehended by the reason alone, reason
"is the veridical and religious part of the nature of man."<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a>

"reason," however, as we shall see presently, Cousin does not
mean the discursive or reflective reason, but the spontaneous
or intuitive reason. That act of the mind by which we attain
to religious knowledge is not a <i>process of reasoning</i>, but a pure
appreciation, an instinctive and involuntary movement of the
soul.</p>

<p>The especial function of reason, therefore, is to reveal to us
the invisible, the supersensuous, the Divine. "It was bestowed
upon us for this very purpose of going, without any circuit of
reasoning, from the visible to the invisible, from the finite to the
infinite, from the imperfect to the perfect, and from necessary
and eternal truths, to the eternal and necessary principle" that
is God.<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a>
<a href="#footnote67"><sup class="sml">67</sup></a> Reason is thus, as it were, the bridge between consciousness
and being; it rests, at the same time, on both; it descends
from God, and approaches man; it makes its appearance
in consciousness as a guest which brings intelligence of
another world of real Being which lies beyond the world of
sense.</p>

<p>Reason does not, however, attain to the Absolute Being directly
and immediately, without any intervening medium. To
assert this would be to fall into the error of Plotinus, and the
Alexandrian Mystics. Reason is the offspring of God, a ray
of the Eternal Reason, but it is not to be identified with God.
Reason attains to the Absolute Being indirectly, and by the interposition
of truth. Absolute truth is an attribute and a manifestation
of God. "Truth is incomprehensible without God,
and God is incomprehensible without truth. Truth is placed
between human intelligence, and the supreme intelligence as a
kind of mediator."<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a>
<a href="#footnote68"><sup class="sml">68</sup></a> Incapable of contemplating God face to

<p>Absolute truth is thus a revelation of God, made by God to
the reason of man, and as it is a light which illuminates every
man, and is perpetually perceived by all men, it is a universal
and perpetual revelation of God to man. The mind of man is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="80" >80</a></span>
"the offspring of God," and, as such, must have some resemblance
to, and some correlation with God. Now that which
constitutes the image of God in man must be found in the reason
which is correlated with, and capable of perceiving the
truth which manifests God, just as the eye is correlated to the
light which manifests the external world. Absolute truth is,
therefore, the sole medium of bringing the human mind into
communion with God; and human reason, in becoming united
to absolute truth, becomes united to God in his manifestation
in spirit and in truth. The supreme law, and highest destination
of man, is to become united to God by seeking a full consciousness
of, and loving and practising the Truth.<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a>

<p>It will at once be obvious that the grand crucial questions
by which this philosophy of religion is to be tested are--</p>

<p>1st. <i>How will Cousin prove to us that human reason is in possession
of universal and necessary principles or absolute truths?</i> and,</p>

<p>2d. <i>How are these principles shown to be absolute? how far do
these principles of reason possess absolute authority?</i></p>

<p>The answer of Cousin to the first question is that we prove
reason to be in possession of universal and necessary principles
by the analysis of the contents of consciousness, that is, by
psychological analysis. The phenomena of consciousness, in
their primitive condition, are necessarily complex, concrete, and
particular. All our primary ideas are complex ideas, for the
evident reason that all, or nearly all, our faculties enter at once
into exercise; their simultaneous action giving us, at the same
time, a certain number of ideas connected with each other, and
forming a whole. For example, the idea of the exterior world,
which is given us so quickly, is a complex idea, which contains
a number of ideas. There is the idea of the secondary qualities
of exterior objects; there is the idea of the primary qualities;
there is the idea of the permanent reality of something to
which you refer these qualities, to wit, matter; there is the idea
of space which contains bodies; there is the idea of time in
which movements are effected. All these ideas are acquired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="81" >81</a></span>
simultaneously, or nearly simultaneously, and together form
one complex idea.</p>

<p>The application of analysis to this complex phenomenon
clearly reveals that there are simple ideas, beliefs, principles in
the mind which can not have been derived from sense and experience,
which sense and experience do not account for, and
which are the suggestions of reason alone: the idea of the <i>Infinite</i>,
the <i>Perfect</i>, the <i>Eternal</i>; the true, the beautiful, the good;
the principle of causality, of substance, of unity, of intentionality;
the principle of duty, of obligation, of accountability, of
retribution. These principles, in their natural and regular development,
carry us beyond the limits of consciousness, and reveal
to us a world of real being beyond the world of sense.
They carry us up to an absolute Being, the fountain of all existence--a
living, personal, righteous God--the author, the sustainer,
and ruler of the universe.</p>

<p>The proof that these principles are absolute, and possessed
of absolute authority, is drawn, first, from the <i>impersonality of
reason</i>, or, rather, the impersonality of the ideas, principles, or
truths of reason.</p>

<p>It is not we who create these ideas, neither can we change
them at our pleasure. We are conscious that the will, in all
its various efforts, is enstamped with the impress of our personality.
Our volitions are our own. So, also, our desires are our
own, our emotions are our own. But this is not the same with
our rational ideas or principles. The ideas of substance, of
cause, of unity, of intentionality do not belong to one person
any more than to another; they belong to mind as mind, they
are revealed in the universal intelligence of the race. Absolute
truth has no element of personality about it. Man may
say "my reason," but give him credit for never having dared to
say "<i>my</i> truth." So far from rational ideas being individual,
their peculiar characteristic is that they are opposed to individuality,
that is, they are universal and necessary. Instead of
being circumscribed within the limits of experience, they surpass
and govern it; they are universal in the midst of particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="82" >82</a></span>
phenomena; necessary, although mingled with things contingent;
and absolute, even when appearing within us the relative
and finite beings that we are.<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a>
<a href="#footnote70"><sup class="sml">70</sup></a> Necessary, universal, absolute
truth is a direct emanation from God. "Such being the
case, the decision of reason within its own peculiar province
possesses an authority almost divine. If we are led astray by
it, we must be led astray by a light from heaven."<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a>

<p>The second proof is derived from <i>the distinction between the
spontaneous and reflective movements of reason</i>.</p>

<p>Reflection is voluntary, spontaneity is involuntary; reflection
is personal, spontaneity is impersonal; reflection is analytic,
spontaneity is synthetic; reflection begins with doubt, spontaneity
with affirmation; reflection belongs to certain ones,
spontaneity belongs to all; reflection produces science, spontaneity
gives truth. Reflection is a process, more or less tardy,
in the individual and in the race. It sometimes engenders error
and skepticism, sometimes convictions that, from being rational,
are only the more profound. It constructs systems, it
creates artificial logic, and all those formulas which we now use
by the force of habit, as if they were natural to us. But spontaneous
intuition is the true logic of nature,--instant, direct,
and infallible. It is a primitive affirmation which implies no
negation, and therefore yields positive knowledge. To reflect
is to return to that which was. It is, by the aid of memory, to
return to the past, and to render it present to the eye of consciousness.
Reflection, therefore, creates nothing; it supposes
an anterior operation of the mind in which there necessarily
must be as many terms as are discovered by reflection. Before
all reflection there comes spontaneity--a spontaneity of the intellect,
which seizes truth at once, without traversing doubt and
error. "We thus attain to a judgment free from all reflection,
to an affirmation without any mixture of negation, to an immediate
intuition, the legitimate daughter of the natural energy of
thought, like the inspiration of the poet, the instinct of the hero,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="83">83</a></span>
the enthusiasm of the prophet." Such is the first act of knowing,
and in this first act the mind passes from <i>idea to being</i> without
ever suspecting the depth of the chasm it has passed. It
passes by means of the power which is in it, and is not astonished
at what it has done. It is subsequently astonished when
by reflection it returns to the analysis of the results, and, by the
aid of the liberty with which it is endowed, to do the opposite
of what it has done, to deny what it has affirmed. "Hence
comes the strife between sophism and common sense, between
false science and natural truth, between good and bad philosophy,
both of which come from free reflection."<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a>
<a href="#footnote72"><sup class="sml">72</sup></a></p>

<p>It is this spontaneity of thought which gives birth to <i>religion.</i>
The instinctive thought which darts through the world, even to
God, is natural religion. "All thought implies a spontaneous
faith in God, and there is no such thing as natural atheism.
Doubt and skepticism may mingle with reflective thought, but
beneath reflection there is still spontaneity. When the scholar
has denied the existence of God, listen to the man, interrogate
him, take him unawares, and you will see that all his words envelop
the idea of God, and that faith in God is, without his
recognition, at the bottom, in his heart."<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a>
<a href="#footnote73"><sup class="sml">73</sup></a></p>

<p>Religion, then, in the system of Cousin, does not begin with
reflection, with science, but with <i>faith</i>. There is, however, this
difference to be noted between the theory of the "faith-philosophers"
(Jacobi, Schleiermacher, etc.) and the theory of Cousin.
With them, faith is grounded on sensation or <i>feeling</i>; with him,
it is grounded on <i>reason</i>. "Faith, whatever may be its form,
whatever may be its object, common or sublime, can be nothing
else than the <i>consent of reason</i>. That is the foundation of
faith."<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a>

<p>Religion is, therefore, with Cousin, at bottom, pure Theism.
He thinks, however, that "true theism is not a dead religion
that forgets precisely the fundamental attributes of God." It
recognizes God as creator, preserver, and governor; it celebrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="84" >84</a></span>
a providence; it adores a perfect, holy, righteous, benevolent
God. It holds the principle of duty, of obligation, of
moral desert. It not only perceives the divine character, but
feels its relation to God. The revelation of the Infinite, by reason,
moves the feelings, and passes into sentiment, producing
reverence, and love, and gratitude. And it creates worship,
which recalls man to God a thousand times more forcibly than
the order, harmony, and beauty of the universe can do.</p>

<p>The spontaneous action of reason, in its greatest energy, is
<i>inspiration</i>. "Inspiration, daughter of the soul and heaven,
speaks from on high with an absolute authority. It commands
faith; so all its words are hymns, and its natural language is
poetry." "Thus, in the cradle of civilization, he who possessed
in a higher degree than his fellows the gift of inspiration,
passed for the confidant and the interpreter of God. He is so
for others, because he is so for himself; and he is so, in fact, in
a philosophic sense. Behold the sacred origin of prophecies,
of pontificates, and of modes of worship."<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a>

(return) </a> "Hist. of Philos.," vol. i. p. 129.</blockquote>

<p>As an account of the genesis of the idea of God in the human
intelligence, the doctrine of Cousin must be regarded as
eminently logical, adequate, and satisfactory. As a theory of
the origin of religion, as a philosophy which shall explain all
the phenomena of religion, it must be pronounced defective,
and, in some of its aspects, erroneous.</p>

<p>First, it does not take proper account of that <i>living force</i>
which has in all ages developed so much energy, and wrought
such vast results in the history of religion, viz., the <i>power of the heart</i>.
Cousin discourses eloquently on the spontaneous, instinctive
movements of the reason, but he overlooks, in a great
measure, the instinctive movements of the heart. He does not
duly estimate the feeling of reverence and awe which rises spontaneously
in presence of the vastness and grandeur of the universe,
and of the power and glory of which the created universe
is a symbol and shadow. He disregards that sense of an overshadowing
Presence which, at least in seasons of tenderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="85" >85</a></span>
and deep sensibility, seems to compass us about, and lay its
hand upon us. He scarcely recognizes the deep consciousness
of imperfection and weakness, and utter dependence, which
prompts man to seek for and implore the aid of a Superior Being;
and, above all, he takes no proper account of the sense of
guilt and the conscious need of expiation. His theory, therefore,
can not adequately explain the universal prevalence of
sacrifices, penances, and prayers. In short, it does not meet
and answer to the deep longings of the human heart, the wants,
sufferings, fears, and hopes of man.</p>

<p>Cousin claims that the universal reason of man is illuminated
by the light of God. It is quite pertinent to ask, Why may
not the universal heart of humanity be touched and moved by
the spirit of God? If the ideas of reason be a revelation from
God, may not the instinctive feelings of the heart be an inspiration
of God? May not God come near to the heart of man and
awaken a mysterious presentiment of an invisible Presence, and
an instinctive longing to come nearer to Him? May he not
draw men towards himself by sweet, persuasive influences, and
raise man to a conscious fellowship? Is not God indeed the
<i>great want</i> of the human heart?</p>

<p>Secondly, Cousin does not give due importance to the influence
of revealed truth as given in the sacred Scriptures, and
of the positive institutions of religion, as a divine economy, supernaturally
originated in the world. He grants, indeed, that
"a primitive revelation throws light upon the cradle of human
civilization," and that "all antique traditions refer to an age in
which man, at his departure from the hand of God, received
from him immediately all lights, and all truths."<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a>
<a href="#footnote76"><sup class="sml">76</sup></a> He also believes
that "the Mosaic religion, by its developments, is mingled
with the history of all the surrounding people of Egypt, of Assyria,
of Persia, and of Greece and Rome."<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a>
<a href="#footnote77"><sup class="sml">77</sup></a> Christianity, however,
is regarded as "the summing and crown of the two great
religious systems which reigned by turn in the East and in
Greece"--the maturity of Ethnicism and Judaism; a development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="86" >86</a></span>
rather than a new creation. The explanation which he
offers of the phenomena of inspiration opens the door to religious
skepticism. Those who were termed seers, prophets, inspired
teachers of ancient times, were simply men who resigned
themselves wholly to their intellectual instincts, and thus gazed
upon truth in its pure and perfect form. They did not reason,
they did not reflect, they made no pretensions to philosophy
they received truth spontaneously as it flowed in upon them
from heaven.<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a>
<a href="#footnote78"><sup class="sml">78</sup></a> This immediate reception of Divine light was
nothing more than the <i>natural</i> play of spontaneous reason
nothing more than what has existed to a greater or less degree
in every man of great genius; nothing more than may
now exist in any mind which resigns itself to its own unreflective
apperceptions. Thus revelation, in its proper sense, loses
all its peculiar value, and Christianity is robbed of its pre-eminent
authority. The extremes of Mysticism and Rationalism
here meet on the same ground, and Plotinus and Cousin are at
one.</p>

<p>V. The fifth hypothesis offered in explanation of the religious
phenomena of the world is that they had their origin <i>in</i> EXTERNAL
REVELATION, <i>to which reason is related as a purely passive
organ, and Ethnicism as a feeble relic</i>.</p>

<p>This is the theory of the school of "dogmatic theologians,"
of which the ablest and most familiar presentation is found in
the "Theological Institutes" of R. Watson.<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a>
<a href="#footnote79"><sup class="sml">79</sup></a> He claims that
all our religious knowledge is derived from <i>oral revelation alone</i>,
and that all the forms of religion and modes of worship which
have prevailed in the heathen world have been perversions and
corruptions of the one true religion first taught to the earliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="87" >87</a></span>
families of men by God himself. All the ideas of God, duty,
immortality, and future retribution which are now possessed, or
have ever been possessed by the heathen nations, are only
broken and scattered rays of the primitive traditions descending
from the family of Noah, and revived by subsequent intercourses
with the Hebrew race; and all the modes of religious
worship--prayers, lustrations, sacrifices--that have obtained
in the world, are but feeble relics, faint reminiscences of
the primitive worship divinely instituted among the first families
of men. "The first man received the knowledge of God by
sensible converse with him, and that doctrine was transmitted,
with the confirmation of successive manifestations, to the early
ancestors of all nations."<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a>
<a href="#footnote80"><sup class="sml">80</sup></a> This belief in the existence of a
Supreme Being was preserved among the Jews by continual
manifestations of the presence of Jehovah. "The intercourses
between the Jews and the states of Syria and Babylon, on the
one hand, and Egypt on the other, powers which rose to great
eminence and influence in the ancient world, was maintained
for ages. Their frequent dispersions and captivities would tend
to preserve in part, and in part to revive, the knowledge of the
once common and universal faith."<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a>

<a href="#footnote82"><sup class="sml">82</sup></a> Among the heathen nations this primitive revelation
was corrupted by philosophic speculation, as in India and
China, Greece and Rome; and in some cases it was entirely

<p>The improbability, inadequacy, and incompleteness of this
theory will be obvious from the following considerations:</p>

<p>1. It is highly improbable that truths so important and vital
to man, so essential to the well-being of the human race, so
necessary to the perfect development of humanity as are the
ideas of God, duty, and immortality, should rest on so precarious
and uncertain a basis as tradition is admitted, even by Mr.
Watson, to be.</p>

<p>The human mind needs the idea of God to satisfy its deep
moral necessities, and to harmonize all its powers. The perfection
of humanity can never be secured, the destination of
humanity can never be achieved, the purpose of God in the existence
of humanity can never be accomplished, without the idea
of God, and of the relation of man to God, being present to
the human mind. Society needs the idea of a Supreme Ruler
as the foundation of law and government, and as the basis of
social order. Without it, these can not be, or be conserved.
Intellectual creatureship, social order, human progress, are inconceivable
and impossible without the idea of God, and of accountability
to God. Now that truths so fundamental should,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="89" >89</a></span>
to the masses of men, rest on tradition <i>alone</i>, is incredible. Is
there no known and accessible God to the outlying millions of
our race who, in consequence of the circumstances of birth and
education, which are beyond their control, have had no access
to an oral revelation, and among whom the dim shadowy rays
of an ancient tradition have long ago expired? Are the eight
hundred millions of our race upon whom the light of Christianity
has not shone unvisited by the common Father of our race?
Has the universal Father left his "own offspring" without a
single native power of recognizing the existence of the Divine
Parent, and abandoned them to solitary and dreary orphanage?
Could not he who gave to matter its properties and laws,--the
properties and laws through whose operation he is working out
his own purposes in the realm of nature,--could not he have
also given to mind ideas and principles which, logically developed,
would lead to recognition of a God, and of our duty to
God, and, by these ideas and principles, have wrought out his
sublime purposes in the realm of mind? Could not he who
gave to man the appetency for food, and implanted in his nature
the social instincts to preserve his physical being, have implanted
in his heart a "feeling after God," and an instinct to
worship God in order to the conservation of his spiritual being?
How otherwise can we affirm the responsibility and accountability
of all the race before God? Those theologians who are
so earnest in the assertion that God has not endowed man with
the native power of attaining the knowledge of God can not,
on any principle of equity, show how the heathen are "without
excuse" when, in involuntary ignorance of God, they "worship
the creature instead of the Creator," and violate a law of duty
of which they have no possible means to attain the barest
knowledge.</p>

<p>2. This theory is utterly inadequate to the explanation of the
<i>universality</i> of religious rites, and especially of religious ideas.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the idea of God. As a matter of fact we
affirm, in opposition to Watson, the universality of this idea.
The idea of God is connatural to the human mind. Wherever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="90" >90</a></span>
human reason has had its normal and healthy development<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a>
<a href="#footnote87"><sup class="sml">87</sup></a>,
this idea has arisen spontaneously and necessarily. There has
not been found a race of men who were utterly destitute of
some knowledge of a Supreme Being. All the instances alleged
have, on further and more accurate inquiry, been found
incorrect. The tendency of the last century, arbitrarily to quadrate
all the facts of religious history with the prevalent sensational
philosophy, had its influence upon the minds of the first
missionaries to India, China, Africa, Australia, and the islands
of the Pacific. They <i>expected</i> to find that the heathen had no
knowledge of a Supreme Being, and before they had mastered
the idioms of their language, or become familiar with their mythological
and cosmological systems, they reported them as <i>utterly
ignorant of God</i>, destitute of the idea and even the name of
a Supreme Being. These mistaken and hasty conclusions
have, however, been corrected by a more intimate acquaintance
with the people, their languages and religions. Even in the
absence of any better information, we should be constrained to
doubt the accuracy of the authorities quoted by Mr. Watson in
relation to Hindooism, when by one (Ward) we are told that
the Hindoo "believes in a God destitute of <i>intelligence</i>" and by
another (Moore) that "Brahm is the one eternal <i>Mind</i>, the self-existent,
incomprehensible Spirit". Learned and trustworthy
critics, Asiatic as well as European, however, confidently affirm
that "the ground of the Brahminical faith is Monotheistic;" it
recognizes "an Absolute and Supreme Being" as the source of
all that exists.<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a>
<a href="#footnote88"><sup class="sml">88</sup></a> Eugene Burnouf, M. Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire,
Kœppen, and indeed nearly all who have written on the subject
of Buddhism, have shown that the metaphysical doctrines of
Buddha were borrowed from the earlier systems of the Brahminic
philosophy. "Buddha." we are told, is "<i>pure intelligence</i>"
"<i>clear light</i>", "<i>perfect wisdom</i>;" the same as Brahm. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="91" >91</a></span>
surely Theism in its highest conception.<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a>
<a href="#footnote89"><sup class="sml">89</sup></a> In regard to the
peoples of South Africa, Dr. Livingstone assures us "there is
no need for beginning to tell even the most degraded of these
people of the existence of a God, or of a future state--the facts
being universally admitted.... On questioning intelligent men
among the Backwains as to their former knowledge of good
and evil, of God, and of a future state, they have scouted the
idea of any of them ever having been without a tolerably clear
conception on all these subjects."<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a>
<a href="#footnote90"><sup class="sml">90</sup></a> And so far from the New
Hollanders having no idea of a Supreme Being, we are assured
by E. Stone Parker, the protector of the aborigines of New Holland,
they have a clear and well-defined idea of a "<i>Great Spirit</i>,"
the maker of all things.</p>

<p>Now had the idea of God rested <i>solely</i> on tradition, it were
the most natural probability that it might be lost, nay, <i>must</i> be
lost, amongst those races of men who were geographically and
chronologically far removed from the primitive cradle of humanity
in the East. The people who, in their migrations, had
wandered to the remotest parts of the earth, and had become
isolated from the rest of mankind, might, after the lapse of ages,
be expected to lose the idea of God, if it were not a spontaneous
and native intuition of the mind,--a necessity of thought.
A fact of history must be presumed to stick to the mind with
much greater tenacity than a purely rational idea which has no
visible symbol in the sensible world, and yet, even in regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="92" >92</a></span>
the events of history, the persistence and pertinacity of tradition
is exceedingly feeble. The South Sea Islanders know
not from whence, or at what time, their ancestors came. There
are monuments in Tonga and Fiji of which the present inhabitants
can give no account. How, then, can a pure, abstract
idea which can have no sensible representation, no visible
image, retain its hold upon the memory of humanity for thousands
of years? The Fijian may not remember whence his immediate
ancestors came, but he knows that the race came originally
from the hands of the Creator. He can not tell who
built the monuments of solid masonry which are found in his
island-home, but he can tell who reared the everlasting hills
and built the universe. He may not know who reigned in
Vewa a hundred years ago, but he knows who now reigns, and
has always reigned, over the whole earth. "The idea of a God
is familiar to the Fijian, and the existence of an invisible superhuman
power controlling and influencing nature, and all
earthly things, is fully recognized by him."<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a>

<p>3. A verbal revelation would be inadequate to convey the
knowledge of God to an intelligence "<i>purely passive</i>" and utterly
unfurnished with any <i>à priori</i> ideas or necessary laws of
cognition and thought.</p>

<p>Of course it is not denied that important verbal communications
relating to the character of God, and the duties we owe
to God, were given to the first human pair, more clear and definite,
it may be, than any knowledge attained by Socrates and
Plato through their dialectic processes, and that these oral
revelations were successively repeated and enlarged to the patriarchs
and prophets of the Old Testament church. And furthermore,
that some rays of light proceeding from this pure
fountain of truth were diffused, and are still lingering among
the heathen nations, we have no desire, and no need to deny.</p>

<p>All this, however, supposes, at least, a natural power and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="93" >93</a></span>
aptitude for the knowledge of God, and some configuration and
correlation of the human intelligence to the Divine. "We
have no knowledge of a dynamic influence, spiritual or natural,
without a dynamic reaction." Matter can not be moved and
controlled by forces and laws, unless it have properties which
correlate it with those forces and laws. And mind can not be
determined from without to any specific form of cognition, unless
it have active powers of apprehension and conception
which are governed by uniform laws. The "material" of
thought may be supplied from without, but the "form" is determined
by the necessary laws of our inward being. All our
cognition of the external world is conditioned by the <i>à priori</i>
ideas of time and space, and all our thinking is governed by
the principles of causality and substance, and the law of "sufficient
reason." The mind itself supplies an element of knowledge
in all our cognitions. Man can not be taught the knowledge
of God if he be not naturally possessed of a presentiment,
or an apperception of a God, as the cause and reason of the
universe. "If education be not already preceded by an innate
consciousness of God, as an operative predisposition, there
would be nothing for education and culture to act upon."<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a>
<a href="#footnote92"><sup class="sml">92</sup></a> A
mere verbal revelation can not communicate the knowledge of
God, if man have not already the idea of a God in his mind.
A name is a mere empty sign, a meaningless symbol, without a
mental image of the object which it represents, or an innate
perception, or an abstract conception of the mind, of which the
word is the sign. The mental image or the abstract conception
must, therefore, precede the name; cognition must be anterior
to, and give the meaning of language.<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a>
<a href="#footnote93"><sup class="sml">93</sup></a> The child knows
a thing even before it can speak its name. And, universally,
we must know the <i>thing</i> in itself, or image it by analogies and
resemblances to some other thing we do know, before the name
can have any meaning for us. As to purely rational ideas and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="94" >94</a></span>
abstract conceptions,--as space, cause, the infinite, the perfect,--language
can never convey these to the mind, nor can
the mind ever attain them by experience if they are not an original,
connate part of our mental equipment and furniture. The
mere verbal affirmation "there is a God" made to one who has
no idea of a God, would be meaningless and unintelligible.
What notion can a man form of "the First Cause" if the principle
of causality is not inherent in his mind? What conception
can he form of "the Infinite Mind" if the infinite be not
a primitive intuition? How can he conceive of "a Righteous
Governor" if he have no idea of right, no sense of obligation,
no apprehension of a retribution? Words are empty sounds
without ideas, and God is a mere name if the mind has no apperception
of a God.</p>

<p>It may be affirmed that, preceding or accompanying the announcement
of the Divine Name, there was given to the first
human pair, and to the early fathers of our race, some visible
manifestation of the presence of God, and some supernatural
display of divine power. What, then, was the character of
these early manifestations, and were they adequate to convey
the proper idea of God? Did God first reveal himself in human
form, and if so, how could their conception of God advance
beyond a rude anthropomorphism? Did he reveal his
presence in a vast columnar cloud or a pillar of fire? How
could such an image convey any conception of the intelligence,
the omnipresence, the eternity of God? Nay, can the infinite
and eternal Mind be represented by any visible manifestation?
Can the human mind conceive an image of God? The knowledge
of God, it is clear, can not be conveyed by any sensible
sign or symbol if man has no prior rational idea of God as the
Infinite and the Perfect Being.</p>

<p>If the facts of order, and design, and special adaptation
which crowd the universe, and the <i>à priori</i> ideas of an unconditioned
Cause and an infinite Intelligence which arise in the
mind in presence of these facts, are inadequate to produce the
logical conviction that it is the work of an intelligent mind, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="95" >95</a></span>
can any preternatural display of <i>power</i> produce a rational conviction
that God exists? "If the universe could come by
chance or fate, surely all the lesser phenomena, termed miraculous,
might occur so too."<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a>
<a href="#footnote94"><sup class="sml">94</sup></a> If we find ourselves standing
amid an eternal series of events, may not miracles be a part of
that series? Or if all things are the result of necessary and
unchangeable laws, may not miracles also result from some natural
or psychological law of which we are yet in ignorance?
Let it be granted that man is <i>not</i> so constituted that, by the
necessary laws of his intelligence, he must affirm that facts of
order having a commencement in time prove mind; let it be
granted that man has <i>no</i> intuitive belief in the Infinite and Perfect--in
short, no idea of God; how, then, could a marvellous
display of <i>power</i>, a new, peculiar, and startling phenomenon
which even seemed to transcend nature, prove to him the existence
of an infinite <i>intelligence</i>--a personal God? The proof
would be simply inadequate, because not the right kind of
proof. Power does not indicate intelligence, force does not
imply personality.</p>

<p>Miracles, in short, were never intended to prove the existence
of God. The foundation of this truth had already been
laid in the constitution and laws of the human mind, and miracles
were designed to convince us that He of whose existence
we had a prior certainty, spoke to us by His Messenger, and
in this way attested his credentials. To the man who has a
rational belief in the existence of God this evidence of a divine
mission is at once appropriate and conclusive. "Master, we
know thou art a teacher sent from God; for no man can do the
works which thou doest, except God be with him." The Christian
missionary does not commence his instruction to the
heathen, who have an imperfect, or even erroneous conception
of "the Great Spirit," by narrating the miracles of Christ, or
quoting the testimony of the Divine Book he carries along with
him. He points to the heavens and the earth, and says,
"There is a Being who made all these things, and Jehovah is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="96" >96</a></span>
his name; I have come to you with a message from Him!"
Or he need scarce do even so much; for already the heathen,
in view of the order and beauty which pervades the universe,
has been constrained, by the laws of his own intelligence, to believe
in and offer worship to the "Ἄγνωστος Θεος"--the unseen
and incomprehensible God; and pointing to their altars, he
may announce with Paul, "this God <i>whom ye worship</i>, though
ignorantly, him declare I unto you!"</p>

<p>The results of our study of the various hypotheses which
have been offered in explanation of the religious phenomena of
the world may be summed up as follows: The first and second
theories we have rejected as utterly false. Instead of being
faithful to and adequately explaining the facts, they pervert,
and maltreat, and distort the facts of religious history. The
last three each contain a precious element of truth which must
not be undervalued, and which can not be omitted in an explanation
which can be pronounced complete. Each theory,
taken by itself, is incomplete and inadequate. The third hypothesis
overrates <i>feeling</i>; the fourth, <i>reason</i>; the fifth, <i>verbal
instruction</i>. The first extreme is Mysticism, the second is Rationalism,
the last is Dogmatism. Reason, feeling, and faith
in testimony must be combined, and mutually condition each
other. No purely rationalistic hypothesis will meet and satisfy
the wants and yearnings of the heart. No theory based on
feeling alone can satisfy the demands of the human intellect.
And, finally, an hypothesis which bases all religion upon historical
testimony and outward fact, and despises and tramples
upon the intuitions of the reason and the instincts of the heart
can never command the general faith of mankind. Religion
embraces and conditionates the whole sphere of life--thought,
feeling, faith, and action; it must therefore be grounded in the
entire spiritual nature of man.</p>

<p>Our criticism of opposite theories has thus prepared the way
for, and obviated the necessity of an extended discussion of the
hypothesis we now advance.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="97" >97</a></span>

<p><i>The universal phenomenon of religion has originated in the à
priori apperceptions of reason, and the natural instinctive feelings
of the heart, which, from age to age, have been vitalized, unfolded,
and perfected by supernatural communications and testamentary
revelations</i>.</p>

<p>There are universal facts of religious history which can only
be explained on the first principle of this hypothesis; there are
special facts which can only be explained on the latter principle.
The universal prevalence of the idea of God, and the feeling
of obligation to obey and worship God, belong to the first
order of facts; the general prevalence of expiatory sacrifices,
of the rite of circumcision, and the observance of sacred and
holy days, belong to the latter. To the last class of facts the
observance of the Christian Sabbath, and the rites of Baptism
and the Lord's Supper may be added.</p>

<p>The history of all religions clearly attests that there are two
orders of principles--the <i>natural</i> and the <i>positive</i>, and, in some
measure, two authorities of religious life which are intimately
related without negativing each other. The characteristic of
the natural is that it is <i>intrinsic</i>, of the positive, that it is <i>extrinsic</i>.
In all ages men have sought the authority of the positive
in that which is immediately <i>beyond</i> and above man--in some
"voice of the Divinity" toning down the stream of ages, or
speaking through a prophet or oracle, or written in some inspired
and sacred book. They have sought for the authority
of the natural in that which is immediately <i>within</i> man--the
voice of the Divinity speaking in the conscience and heart of
man. A careful study of the history of religion will show a reciprocal
relation between the two, and indicate their common
source.</p>

<p>We expect to find that our hypothesis will be abundantly
sustained by the study of the <i>Religion of the Athenians</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE ATHENIANS.</h3>

<p>"All things which I behold bear witness to your carefulness in religion
(δεισιδαιµονεστέρους). For as I passed through your city, and beheld the objects
of your worship, I found amongst them an altar with this inscription--'TO
THE UNKNOWN GOD.' Whom therefore ye worship...."--ST. PAUL.</p>

<p>Through one of those remarkable counter-strokes of
Divine Providence by which the evil designs of men are
overruled, and made to subserve the purposes of God, the Apostle
Paul was brought to Athens. He walked beneath its stately
porticoes, he entered its solemn temples, he stood before its
glorious statuary, he viewed its beautiful altars--all devoted to
pagan worship. And "his spirit was stirred within him," he
was moved with indignation "when he saw the city full of images
of the gods."<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a>
<a href="#footnote95"><sup class="sml">95</sup></a> At the very entrance of the city he met the
evidence of this peculiar tendency of the Athenians to multiply
the objects of their devotion; for here at the gateway stands
an image of Neptune, seated on horseback, and brandishing
the trident. Passing through the gate, his attention would be
immediately arrested by the sculptured forms of Minerva, Jupiter,
Apollo, Mercury, and the Muses, standing near a sanctuary
of Bacchus. A long street is now before him, with temples,
statues, and altars crowded on either hand. Walking to the
end of this street, and turning to the right, he entered the Agora,
a public square surrounded with porticoes and temples, which
were adorned with statuary and paintings in honor of the
gods of Grecian mythology. Amid the plane-trees planted by
the hand of Cimon are the statues of the deified heroes of
Athens, Hercules and Theseus, and the whole series of the
Eponymi, together with the memorials of the older divinities;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="99" >99</a></span>
Mercuries which gave the name to the streets on which they
were placed; statues dedicated to Apollo as patron of the
city and her deliverer from the plague; and in the centre of all
the altar of the Twelve Gods.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote95"
name="footnote95"><b>Footnote 95: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag95">
(return) </a> Lange's Commentary, Acts xvii. 16.</blockquote>

<p>Standing in the market-place, and looking up to the Areopagus,
Paul would see the temple of Mars, from whom the hill
derived its name. And turning toward the Acropolis, he
would behold, closing the long perspective, a series of little
sanctuaries on the very ledges of the rocks, shrines of Bacchus
and Æsculapius, Venus, Earth, and Ceres, ending with the
lovely form of the Temple of Unwinged Victory, which glittered
in front of the Propylæa.</p>

<p>If the apostle entered the "fivefold gates," and ascended the
flight of stone steps to the platform of the Acropolis, he would
find the whole area one grand composition of architecture and
statuary dedicated to the worship of the gods. Here stood the
Parthenon, the Virgin House, the glorious temple which was
erected during the proudest days of Athenian glory, an entire
offering to Minerva, the tutelary divinity of Athens. Within
was the colossal statue of the goddess wrought in ivory and
gold. Outside the temple there stood another statue of
Minerva, cast from the brazen spoils of Marathon; and near
by yet another brazen Pallas, which was called by pre-eminence
"the Beautiful."</p>

<p>Indeed, to whatever part of Athens the apostle wandered,
he would meet the evidences of their "carefulness in religion,"
for every public place and every public building was a sanctuary
of some god. The Metroum, or record-house, was a temple
to the mother of the gods. The council-house held statues of
Apollo and Jupiter, with an altar to Vesta. The theatre at
the base of the Acropolis was consecrated to Bacchus. The
Pnyx was dedicated to Jupiter on high. And as if, in this direction,
the Attic imagination knew no bounds, abstractions
were deified; altars were erected to Fame, to Energy, to Modesty,
and even to Pity, and these abstractions were honored
and worshipped as gods.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="100">100</a></span>

<p>The impression made upon the mind of Paul was, that the
city was literally "full of idols," or images of the gods. This
impression is sustained by the testimony of numerous Greek
and Roman writers. Pausanias declares that Athens "had
more images than all the rest of Greece;" and Petronius, the
Roman satirist, says, "it was easier to find a god in Athens
than a man."<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a>
<a href="#footnote96"><sup class="sml">96</sup></a></p>

(return) </a> See Conybeare and Howson's "Life and Epistles of St. Paul;" also,
art. "Athens," in <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, whence our account of the "sacred
objects" in Athens is chiefly gathered.</blockquote>

<p>No wonder, then, that as Paul wandered amid these scenes
"his spirit was stirred in him." He burned with holy zeal
to maintain the honor of the true and only God, whom now he
saw dishonored on every side. He was filled with compassion
for those Athenians who, notwithstanding their intellectual
greatness, had changed the glory of God into an image made
in the likeness of corruptible man, and who really worshipped
the creature <i>more</i> than the Creator. The images intended to
symbolize the invisible perfections of God were usurping the
place of God, and receiving the worship due alone to him.
We may presume the apostle was not insensible to the beauties
of Grecian art. The sublime architecture of the Propylæa
and the Parthenon, the magnificent sculpture of Phidias and
Praxiteles, could not fail to excite his wonder. But he remembered
that those superb temples and this glorious statuary
were the creation of the pagan spirit, and devoted to polytheistic
worship. The glory of the supreme God was obscured
by all this symbolism. The creatures formed by God, the
symbols of his power and presence in nature, the ministers of
his providence and moral government, were receiving the honor
due to him. Over all this scene of material beauty and
æsthetic perfection there rose in dark and hideous proportions
the errors and delusions and sins against the living God which
Polytheism nurtured, and unable any longer to restrain himself,
he commenced to "reason" with the crowds of Athenians
who stood beneath the shadows of the plane-trees, or lounged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="101">101</a></span>
beneath the porticoes that surrounded the Agora. Among
these groups of idlers were mingled the disciples of Zeno and
Epicurus, who "encountered" Paul. The nature of these
"disputations" may be easily conjectured, The opinions of
these philosophers are even now familiarly known: they are,
in one form or another, current in the literature of modern
times. Materialism and Pantheism still "encounter" Christianity.
The apostle asserted the personal being and spirituality
of one supreme and only God, who has in divers ways revealed
himself to man, and therefore may be "known." He
proclaimed that Jesus is the fullest and most perfect revelation
of God--the <i>only</i> "manifestation of God in the flesh." He
pointed to his "resurrection" as the proof of his superhuman
character and mission to the world. Some of his hearers were
disposed to treat him with contempt; they represented him as
an ignorant "babbler," who had picked up a few scraps of
learning, and who now sought to palm them off as a "new"
philosophy. But most of them regarded him with that peculiar
Attic curiosity which was always anxious to be hearing
some "new thing." So they led him away from the tumult
of the market-place to the top of Mars' Hill, where, in its serene
atmosphere, they might hear him more carefully, and
said, "May we hear what this new doctrine is whereof thou
speakest?"</p>

<p>Surrounded by these men of thoughtful, philosophic mind--men
who had deeply pondered the great problem of existence,
who had earnestly inquired after the "first principles of
things;" men who had reasoned high of creation, fate, and
providence; of right and wrong; of conscience, law, and retribution;
and had formed strong and decided opinions on all
these questions--he delivered his discourse on the <i>being</i>, the
<i>providence</i>, the <i>spirituality</i>, and the <i>moral government</i> of God.</p>

<p>This grand theme was suggested by an inscription he had

For as I passed by and beheld your sacred objects I found an
altar with this inscription, 'To the Unknown God;' whom,
therefore, ye worship, though ye know him not [adequately],
Him declare I unto you." Starting from this point, the manifest
carefulness of the Athenians in religion, and accepting
this inscription as the evidence that they had some presentiment,
some native intuition, some dim conception of the one
true and living God, he strives to lead them to a deeper knowledge
of Him. It is here conceded by the apostle that the
Athenians were a <i>religious people</i>. The observations he had
made during his short stay in Athens enabled him to bear
witness that the Athenians were "a God-fearing people,"<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a>
<a href="#footnote97"><sup class="sml">97</sup></a> and
he felt that fairness and candor demanded that this trait should
receive from him an ample recognition and a full acknowledgment.
Accordingly he commences by saying in gentle terms,
well fitted to conciliate his audience, "All things which I behold
bear witness to your carefulness in religion." I recognize
you as most devout; ye appear to me to be a God-fearing people,<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a>

<p>The assertion that the Athenians were "a religious people"
will, to many of our readers, appear a strange and startling
utterance, which has in it more of novelty than truth. Nay,
some will be shocked to hear the Apostle Paul described as
complimenting these Athenians--these pagan worshippers--on
their "carefulness in religion." We have been so long accustomed
to use the word "heathen" as an opprobrious epithet--expressing,
indeed, the utmost extremes of ignorance, and
barbarism, and cruelty, that it has become difficult for us to believe
that in a heathen there can be any good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="103">103</a></span>
From our childhood we have read in our English Bibles,
Ye men of Athens, I perceive in all things ye are <i>too superstitious</i></p>

<p>and we can scarcely tolerate another version, even if
it can be shown that it approaches nearer to the actual language
employed by Paul. We must, therefore, ask the patience
and candor of the reader, while we endeavor to show, on the
authority of Paul's words, that the Athenians were a "religious
people," and that all our notions to the contrary are founded
on prejudice and misapprehension.</p>

<p>First, then, let us commence even with our English version:
"Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are <i>too
superstitious</i>." And what now is the meaning of the word
"superstition?" It is true, we now use it only in an evil sense,
to express a belief in the agency of invisible, capricious, malignant
powers, which fills the mind with fear and terror, and sees
in every unexplained phenomenon of nature an omen, or prognostic,
of some future evil. But this is not its proper and original
meaning. Superstition is from the Latin <i>superstitio</i>, which
means a superabundance of religion,<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a>
<a href="#footnote99"><sup class="sml">99</sup></a> an extreme exactitude
in religious observance. And this is precisely the sense in
which the corresponding Greek term is used by the Apostle
Paul. Δεισιδαιµονία properly means "reverence for the gods."
"It is used," says Barnes, "in the classic writers, in a good
sense, to denote piety towards the gods, or suitable fear and
reverence for them." "The word," says Lechler, "is, without
doubt, to be understood here in a good sense; although it
seems to have been intentionally chosen, in order to indicate
the conception of <i>fear</i> (δειδω), which predominated in the religion
of the apostle's hearers."<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a>
<a href="#footnote100"><sup class="sml">100</sup></a> This reading is sustained by
the ablest critics and scholars of modern times. Bengel reads
the sentence, "I perceive that ye are <i>very religious</i>"<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a>
<a href="#footnote101"><sup class="sml">101</sup></a> Cudworth
translates it thus: "Ye are every way <i>more than ordinarily religious."<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a>
<a href="#footnote102"><sup class="sml">102</sup></a></i>
Conybeare and Howson read the text as we have
already given it, "All things which I behold bear witness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="104">104</a></span>
your <i>carefulness in religion</i>."<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a>
<a href="#footnote103"><sup class="sml">103</sup></a> Lechler reads "very devout;"<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a>
<a href="#footnote104"><sup class="sml">104</sup></a>
Alford, "carrying your <i>religious reverence very far</i>;"<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a>
<a href="#footnote105"><sup class="sml">105</sup></a> and Albert
Barnes,<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a>
<a href="#footnote106"><sup class="sml">106</sup></a> "I perceive ye are greatly devoted to <i>reverence for religion</i>."<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a>
<a href="#footnote107"><sup class="sml">107</sup></a>
Whoever, therefore, will give attention to the actual
words of the apostle, and search for their real meaning, must
be convinced he opens his address by complimenting the
Athenians on their being more than ordinarily religious.</p>

<p>Nor are we for a moment to suppose the apostle is here
dealing in hollow compliments, or having recourse to a "pious
fraud." Such a course would have been altogether out of
character with Paul, and to suppose him capable of pursuing
such a course is to do him great injustice. If "to the Jews he
became as a Jew," it was because he recognized in Judaism
the same fundamental truths which underlie the Christian system.
And if here he seems to become, in any sense, at one
with "heathenism," that he might gain the heathen to the faith
of Christ, it was because he found in heathenism some elements
of truth akin to Christianity, and a state of feeling favorable
to an inquiry into the truths he had to present. He beheld in
Athens an altar reared to the God <i>he</i> worshipped, and it afforded
him some pleasure to find that God was not totally forgotten,
and his worship totally neglected, by the Athenians. The
God whom they knew imperfectly, "<i>Him</i>" said he, "I declare
unto you;" I now desire to make him more fully known. The
worship of "the Unknown God" was a recognition of the being
of a God whose nature transcends all human thought, a God
who is ineffable; who, as Plato said, "is hard to be discovered,
and having discovered him, to make him known to all, impossible."<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a>
<a href="#footnote108"><sup class="sml">108</sup></a>
It is the confession of a <i>want</i> of knowledge, the expression
of a <i>desire</i> to know, the acknowledgment of the <i>duty</i>
of worshipping him. Underlying all the forms of idol-worship
the eye of Paul recognized an influential Theism. Deep down
in the pagan heart he discovered a "feeling after God"--a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="105">105</a></span>
yearning for a deeper knowledge of the "unknown," the invisible,
the incomprehensible, which he could not despise or disregard.
The mysterious <i>sentiments</i> of fear, of reverence, of conscious
dependence on a supernatural power and presence
overshadowing man, which were expressed in the symbolism
of the "sacred objects" which Paul saw everywhere in Athens,
commanded his respect. And he alludes to their "devotions,"
not in the language of reproach or censure, but as furnishing
to his own mind the evidence of the strength of their <i>religious
instincts</i>, and the proof of the existence in their hearts of that
<i>native apprehension</i> of the supernatural, the divine, which dwells
alike in all human souls.</p>

<p>The case of the Athenians has, therefore, a peculiar interest
to every thoughtful mind. It confirms the belief that religion
is a necessity to every human mind, a want of every human
heart.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a>
<a href="#footnote109"><sup class="sml">109</sup></a> Without religion, the nature of man can never be properly
developed; the noblest part of man--the divine, the spiritual
element which dwells in man, as "the offspring of God"--must
remain utterly dwarfed. The spirit, the personal being,
the rational nature, is religious, and Atheism is the vain
and the wicked attempt to be something less than man. If
the spiritual nature of man has its normal and healthy development,
he must become a worshipper. This is attested by
the universal history of man. We look down the long-drawn
aisles of antiquity, and everywhere we behold the smoking altar,
the ascending incense, the prostrate form, the attitude of devotion.
Athens, with her four thousand deities--Rome, with her
crowded Pantheon of gods--Egypt, with her degrading superstitions--Hindostan,
with her horrid and revolting rites--all
attest that the religious principle is deeply seated in the nature
of man. And we are sure religion can never be robbed of her
supremacy, she can never be dethroned in the hearts of men.
It were easier to satisfy the cravings of hunger by logical syllogisms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="106">106</a></span>
than to satisfy the yearnings of the human heart without
religion. The attempt of Xerxes to bind the rushing floods
of the Hellespont in chains was not more futile nor more impotent
than the attempt of skepticism to repress the universal
tendency to worship, so peculiar and so natural to man in
every age and clime.</p>

emotional nature of man is tacitly confessed by the atheist Comte in the
publication of his "Catechism of Positive Religion."</blockquote>

<p>The unwillingness of many to recognize a religious element
in the Athenian mind is further accounted for by their misconception
of the meaning of the word "religion." We are all
too much accustomed to regard religion as a mere system of
dogmatic teaching. We use the terms "Christian religion,"
"Jewish religion," "Mohammedan religion," as comprehending
simply the characteristic doctrines by which each is distinguished;
whereas religion is a mode of thought, and feeling,
and action, determined by the consciousness of our relation to
and our dependence upon God. It does not appropriate to
itself any specific department of our mental powers and susceptibilities,
but it conditions the entire functions and circle
of our spiritual life. It is not simply a mode of conceiving
God in thought, nor simply a mode of venerating God in the
affections, nor yet simply a mode of worshipping God in outward
and formal acts, but it comprehends the whole. Religion
(<i>religere</i>, respect, awe, reverence) regulates our thoughts, feelings,
and acts towards God. "It is a reference and a relationship
of our finite consciousness to the Creator and Sustainer
and Governor of the universe." It is such a consciousness of
the Divine as shall awaken in the heart of man the sentiments
of reverence, fear, and gratitude towards God; such a sense of
dependence as shall prompt man to pray, and lead him to perform
external acts of worship.</p>

<p>Religion does not, therefore, consist exclusively in knowledge,
however correct; and yet it must be preceded and accompanied
by some intuitive cognition of a Supreme Being,
and some conception of him as a free moral personality. But
the religious sentiments, which belong rather to the heart than
to the understanding of man--the consciousness of dependence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="107" >107</a></span>
the sense of obligation, the feeling of reverence, the instinct
to pray, the appetency to worship--these may all exist
and be largely developed in a human mind even when, as in
the case of the Athenians, there is a very imperfect knowledge
of the real character of God.</p>

<p>Regarding this, then, as the generic conception of religion,
namely, <i>that it is a mode of thought and feeling and action determined
by our consciousness of dependence on a Supreme Being</i>,
we claim that the apostle was perfectly right in complimenting
the Athenians on their "more than ordinary religiousness,"
for,</p>

<p>1. They had, in some degree at least, that faith in the being
and providence of God which precedes and accompanies all religion.</p>

<p>They had erected an altar to the unseen, the unsearchable,
the incomprehensible, the unknown God. And this "unknown
God" whom the Athenians "worshipped" was the true God,
the God whom Paul worshipped, and whom he desired more
fully to reveal to them; "<i>Him</i> declare I unto you." The
Athenians had, therefore, some knowledge of the true God,
some dim recognition, at least, of his being, and some conception,
however imperfect, of his character. The Deity to whom
the Athenians reared this altar is called "the unknown God,"
because he is unseen by all human eyes and incomprehensible
to human thought. There is a sense in which to Paul, as well
as to the Athenians--to the Christian as well as to the pagan--to
the philosopher as well as to the peasant--God is
"<i>the unknown</i>," and in which he must forever remain the
incomprehensible. This has been confessed by all thoughtful
minds in every age. It was confessed by Plato. To his
mind God is "the ineffable," the unspeakable. Zophar, the
friend of Job, asks, "Canst thou by searching find out God?
Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?" This knowledge
is "high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
hell; what canst thou know?" Does not Wesley teach us to
sing,</p>

<p>To his mind, as well as to the mind of the Athenian, God was
"the great unseen, unknown." "Beyond the universe and
man," says Cousin, "there remains in God something unknown,
impenetrable, incomprehensible. Hence, in the immeasurable
spaces of the universe, and beneath all the profundities of the
human soul, God escapes us in this inexhaustible infinitude,

<p>When, therefore, the apostle affirms that while the Athenians
worshipped the God whom he proclaimed they "knew him not,"
we can not understand him as saying they were destitute of all
faith in the being of God, and of all ideas of his real character.
Because for him to have asserted they had <i>no</i> knowledge of
God would not only have been contrary to all the facts of the
case, but also an utter contradiction of all his settled convictions
and his recorded opinions. There is not in modern
times a more earnest asserter of the doctrine that the human
mind has an intuitive cognition of God, and that the external
world reveals God to man. There is a passage in his letter to
the Romans which is justly entitled to stand at the head of all
discourses on "natural theology," Rom. i. 19-21. Speaking of
the heathen world, who had not been favored, as the Jews, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="109">109</a></span>
a verbal revelation, he says, "That which may be known of God
is manifest <i>in</i> them," that is, in the constitution and laws of
their spiritual nature, "for God hath showed it unto them" in
the voice of reason and of conscience, so that in the instincts
of our hearts, in the elements of our moral nature, in the ideas
and laws of our reason, we are taught the being of a God.
These are the subjective teachings of the human soul.</p>

<p>Not only is the being of God revealed to man in the constitution
and laws of his rational and moral nature, but God is
also manifested to us objectively in the realm of things around
us; therefore Paul adds, "The invisible things of him, even his
eternal power and Godhead, from the creation are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made." The world of
sense, therefore, discloses the being and perfections of God.
The invisible attributes of God are made apparent by the things
that are visible. Forth out of nature, as the product of the Divine
Mind, the supernatural shines. The forces, laws, and harmonies
of the universe are indices of the presence of a presiding
and informing Intelligence. The creation itself is an example
of God's coming forth out of the mysterious depths of his
own eternal and invisible being, and making himself apparent
to man. There, on the pages of the volume of nature, we may
read, in the marvellous language of symbol, the grand conceptions,
the glorious thoughts, the ideals of beauty which dwell in
the uncreated Mind, These two sources of knowledge--the subjective
teachings of God in the human soul, and the objective
manifestations of God in the visible universe--harmonize, and,
together, fill up the complement of our natural idea of God.
They are two hemispheres of thought, which together form one
full-orbed fountain of light, and ought never to be separated in
our philosophy. And, inasmuch as this divine light shines on
all human minds, and these works of God are seen by all human
eyes, the apostle argues that the heathen world "is without
excuse, because, knowing God (γνόντες τὸν Θεόν) they did
not glorify him as God, neither were thankful; but in their reasonings
they went astray after vanities, and their hearts, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="110">110</a></span>
void of wisdom, were filled with darkness. Calling themselves
wise, they were turned into fools, and changed the glory of the
imperishable God for idols graven in the likeness of perishable
man, or of birds, and beasts, and creeping things,...and
they bartered the truth of God for lies, and reverenced and
worshipped the things made rather than the Maker, who is blessed
forever. Amen."<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a>

<p>The brief and elliptical report of Paul's address on Mars'
Hill must therefore, in all fairness, be interpreted in the light
of his more carefully elaborated statements in the Epistle to
the Romans. And when Paul intimates that the Athenians
"knew not God," we can not understand him as saying they
had <i>no</i> knowledge, but that their knowledge was imperfect.
They did not know God as Creator, Father, and Ruler; above
all, they did not know him as a pardoning God and a sanctifying
Spirit. They had not that knowledge of God which purifies
the heart, and changes the character, and gives its possessor
eternal life.</p>

<p>The apostle clearly and unequivocally recognizes this truth,
that the idea of God is connatural to the human mind; that
in fact there is not to be found a race of men upon the face of
the globe utterly destitute of some idea of a Supreme Being.
Wherever human reason has had its normal and healthful development,
it has spontaneously and necessarily led the human
mind to the recognition of a God. The Athenians were no exception
to this general law. They believed in the existence of
one supreme and eternal Mind, invisible, incomprehensible, infeffable--"the
unknown God."</p>

<p>2. The Athenians had also that consciousness of dependence
upon God which is the foundation of all the primary religious
emotions.</p>

<p>When the apostle affirmed that "in God we live, and move,
and have our being," he uttered the sentiments of many, if not
all, of his hearers, and in support of that affirmation he could
quote the words of their own poets, for we are also his offspring;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="111">111</a></span>
<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a>
<a href="#footnote113"><sup class="sml">113</sup></a> and, as his offspring, we have a derived and a dependent
being. Indeed, this consciousness of dependence is analogous
to the feeling which is awakened in the heart of a child
when its parent is first manifested to its opening mind as the
giver of those things which it immediately needs, as its continual
protector, and as the preserver of its life. The moment a
man becomes conscious of his own personality, that moment he
becomes conscious of some relation to another personality, to
which he is subject, and on which he depends.<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a>

in human personality, namely, to <i>know</i> and to <i>act</i>. If we would
conceive of them as they exist in the innermost sphere of selfhood,
we must distinguish the first as <i>self-consciousness</i>, and the
second as <i>self-determination</i>. These are unquestionably the two
factors of human personality.</p>

<p>If we consider the first of these factors more closely, we shall
discover that self-consciousness exists under limitations and
conditions. Man can not become clearly conscious of <i>self</i> without
distinguishing himself from the outer world of sensation, nor
without distinguishing self and the world from another being
upon whom they depend as the ultimate substance and cause.
Mere <i>cœnœesthesis</i> is not consciousness. Common feeling is unquestionably
found among the lowest forms of animal life, the
protozoa; but it can never rise to a clear consciousness of personality
until it can distinguish itself from sensation, and acquire
a presentiment of a divine power, on which self and the outer
world depend. The <i>Ego</i> does not exist for itself, can not perceive
itself, but by distinguishing itself from the ceaseless flow
and change of sensation, and by this act of distinguishing, the
<i>Ego</i> takes place in consciousness. And the <i>Ego</i> can not perceive
itself, nor cognize sensation as a state or affection of the
<i>Ego</i> except by the intervention of the reason, which supplies
the two great fundamental laws of causality and substance.
The facts of consciousness thus comprehend three elements--self,
nature, and God. The determinate being, the <i>Ego</i>, is never
an absolutely independent being, but is always in some way or
other codetermined by another; it can not, therefore, be an absolutely
original and independent, but must in some way or
another be a <i>derived</i> and <i>conditioned</i> existence.</p>

<p>Now that which limits and conditions human self-consciousness
can not be mere <i>nature</i>, because nature can not give what
it does not possess; it can not produce what is <i>toto genere</i> different
from itself. Self-consciousness can not arise out of unconsciousness.
This new beginning is beyond the power of
nature. Personal power, the creative principle of all new beginnings,
is alone adequate to its production. If, then, self-consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="113">113</a></span>
exists in man, it necessarily presupposes an absolutely
<i>original</i>, therefore <i>unconditioned, self-consciousness</i>. Human
self-consciousness, in its temporal actualization, of course
presupposes a nature-basis upon which it elevates itself; but
it is only possible on the ground that an eternal self-conscious
Mind ordained and rules over all the processes of nature, and
implants the divine spark of the personal spirit with the corporeal
frame, to realize itself in the light-flame of human self-consciousness.
The original light of the divine self-consciousness
is eternally and absolutely first and before all. "Thus, in the
depths of our own self-consciousness, as its concealed background,
the God-consciousness reveals itself to us. This descent
into our inmost being is at the same time an ascent to God.
Every deep reflection on ourselves breaks through the mere
crust of world-consciousness, which separates us from the inmost
truth of our existence, and leads us up to Him in whom
we live and move and are."<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a>

<p>Self-determination, equally with self-consciousness, exists in
us under manifold <i>limitations</i>. Self-determination is limited
by physical, corporeal, and mental conditions, so that there is
"an impassable boundary line drawn around the area of volitional
freedom." But the most fundamental and original limitation
is that of <i>duty</i>. The self-determining power of man is
not only circumscribed by necessary conditions, but also by
the <i>moral law</i> in the consciousness of man. Self-determination
alone does not suffice for the full conception of responsible
freedom; it only becomes, <i>will</i>, properly by its being an intelligent
and conscious determination; that is, the rational subject
is able previously to recognize "the right," and present before
his mind that which he <i>ought</i> to do, that which he is morally
bound to realize and actualize by his own self-determination
and choice. Accordingly we find in our inmost being a <i>sense
of obligation</i> to obey the moral law as revealed in the conscience.
As we can not become conscious of self without also
becoming conscious of God, so we can not become properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="114">114</a></span>
conscious of self-determination until we have recognized in the
conscience a law for the movements of the will.</p>

<p>Now this moral law, as revealed in the conscience, is not a
mere autonomy--a simple subjective law having no relation to
a personal lawgiver out of and above man. Every admonition
of conscience directly excites the consciousness of a God to
whom man is accountable. The universal consciousness of
our race, as revealed in history, has always associated the phenomena
of conscience with the idea of a personal Power above
man, to whom he is subject and upon whom he depends. In
every age, the voice of conscience has been regarded as the
voice of God, so that when it has filled man with guilty apprehensions,
he has had recourse to sacrifices, and penances, and
prayers to expatiate his wrath.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that if man has <i>duties</i> there must he a
self-conscious Will by whom these duties are imposed, for only
a real will can be legislative. If man has a <i>sense of obligation</i>,
there must be a supreme authority by which he is obliged. If
he is <i>responsible</i>, there must be a being to whom he is
accountable.<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a>
<a href="#footnote116"><sup class="sml">116</sup></a> It can not be said that he is accountable to himself, for
by that supposition the idea of duty is obliterated, and "right"
becomes identical with mere interest or pleasure. It can not
be said that he is simply responsible to society--to mere conventions
of human opinions and human governments--for then
"<i>right</i>" becomes a mere creature of human legislation, and
"<i>justice</i>" is nothing but the arbitrary will of the strong who
tyrannize over the weak. Might constitutes right. Against
such hypotheses the human mind, however, instinctively revolts.
Mankind feel, universally, that there is an authority beyond all
human governments, and a higher law above all human laws,
from whence all their powers are derived. That higher law is
the Law of God, that supreme authority is the God of Justice.
To this eternally just God, innocence, under oppression and
wrong, has made its proud appeal, like that of Prometheus to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="115">115</a></span>
the elements, to the witnessing clouds, to coming ages, and has
been sustained and comforted. And to that higher law the
weak have confidently appealed against the unrighteous enactments
of the strong, and have finally conquered. The last and
inmost ground of all obligation is thus the conscious relation
of the moral creature to God. The sense of absolute dependence
upon a Supreme Being compels man, even while conscious
of subjective freedom, to recognize at the same time his obligation
to determine himself in harmony with the will of Him
"in whom we live, and move, and are."</p>

<p>This feeling of dependence, and this consequent sense of
obligation, lie at the very foundation of all religion. They lead
the mind towards God, and anchor it in the Divine. They
prompt man to pray, and inspire him with an instinctive confidence
in the efficacy of prayer. So that prayer is natural to
man, and necessary to man. Never yet has the traveller found
a people on earth without prayer. Races of men have been
found without houses, without raiment, without arts and sciences,
but never without prayer any more than without speech.
Plutarch wrote, eighteen centuries ago, If you go through all
the world, you may find cities without walls, without letters,
without rulers, without money, without theatres, but never without
temples and gods, or without <i>prayers</i>, oaths, prophecies,
and sacrifices, used to obtain blessings and benefits, or to avert
curses and calamities.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a>
<a href="#footnote117"><sup class="sml">117</sup></a> The naturalness of prayer is admitted
even by the modern unbeliever. Gerrit Smith says, "Let us
who believe that the religion of reason calls for the religion of
nature, remember that the flow of prayer is just as natural as
the flow of water; the prayerless man has become an unnatural
man."<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a>
<a href="#footnote118"><sup class="sml">118</sup></a> Is man in sorrow or in danger, his most natural
and spontaneous refuge is in prayer. The suffering, bewildered,
terror-stricken soul turns towards God. "Nature in an
agony is no atheist; the soul that knows not where to fly, flies
to God." And in the hour of deliverance and joy, a feeling of
gratitude pervades the soul--and gratitude, too, not to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="116">116</a></span>
blind nature-force, to some unconscious and impersonal power,
but gratitude to God. The soul's natural and appropriate language
in the hour of deliverance is thanksgiving and praise.</p>

<p>"The unknown God" was their deliverer from the plague.
And the erection of an altar to him was a confession of their
absolute dependence upon him, of their obligation to worship
him, as well as of their need of a deeper knowledge of him.
The gods who were known and named were not able to deliver
them in times of calamity, and they were compelled to look beyond
the existing forms of Grecian mythology for relief. Beyond
all the gods of the Olympus there was "one God over
all," the Father of gods and men, the Creator of all the subordinate
local deities, upon whom even these created gods were
dependent, upon whom man was absolutely dependent, and
therefore in times of deepest need, of severest suffering, of extremest
peril, then they cried to the living, supreme, eternal
God.<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a>

<p>3. The Athenians developed in a high degree those religious
emotions which always accompany the consciousness of dependence
on a Supreme Being.</p>

<p>The first emotional element of all religion is <i>fear</i>. This is
unquestionably true, whether religion be considered from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="118" >118</a></span>
Christian or a heathen stand-point. "The <i>fear</i> of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom." Associated with, perhaps preceding,
all definite ideas of God, there exists in the human mind
certain feelings of <i>awe</i>, and <i>reverence</i>, and <i>fear</i> which arise
spontaneously in presence of the vastness, and grandeur, and
magnificence of the universe, and of the power and glory of
which the created universe is but the symbol and shadow.
There is the felt apprehension that, beyond and back of the
visible and the tangible, there is a <i>personal, living Power</i>, which
is the foundation of all, and which fashions all, and fills all
with its light and life; that "the universe is the living vesture
in which the Invisible has robed his mysterious loveliness."
There is the feeling of an <i>overshadowing Presence</i> which "compasseth
man behind and before, and lays its hand upon him."</p>

<p>This wonderful presentiment of an invisible power and presence
pervading and informing all nature is beautifully described
by Wordsworth in his history of the development of the Scottish
herdsman's mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">    So the foundations of his mind were laid</p>
<p class="i10">    In such communion, not from terror free.</p>

<p class="i10">    Had he perceived the presence and the power</p>
<p class="i10">    Of greatness; and deep feelings had impressed</p>
<p class="i10">    So vividly great objects, that they lay</p>
<p class="i10">    Upon his mind like substances, whose presence</p>
<p class="i10">    Perplexed the bodily sense.</p>
<p class="i30">                       ... In the after-day</p>
<p class="i10">    Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn,</p>

<p class="i10">    Or from the power of a peculiar eye,</p>
<p class="i10">    Or by creative feeling overborne,</p>
<p class="i10">    Or by predominance of thought oppressed,</p>
<p class="i10">    Even in their fixed and steady lineaments</p>
<p class="i10">    He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind....</p>
<p class="i10">    Such was the Boy,--but for the growing Youth,</p>
<p class="i10">    What soul was his, when, from the naked top</p>
<p class="i10">    Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun</p>
<p class="i10">    Rise up, and bathe the world in light! He looked:</p>
<p class="i10">    Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth</p>
<p class="i10">    And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay</p>
<p class="i10">    Beneath him; far and wide the clouds were touched.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="119">119</a></span>
<p class="i10">    And in their silent faces could he read</p>
<p class="i10">    Unutterable love. Sound needed none,</p>

<p class="i10">    His animal being; in them did he live,</p>
<p class="i10">    And by them did he live; they were his life,</p>

<p>But it may be said this is all mere poetry; to which we answer,

and weightier than history."<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a>
<a href="#footnote126"><sup class="sml">126</sup></a> The true poet is the
interpreter of nature. His soul is in the fullest sympathy with
the grand ideas which nature symbolizes, and he "deciphers
the universe as the autobiography of the Infinite Spirit."
Spontaneous feeling is a kind of inspiration.</p>

<p>It is true that all minds may not be developed in precisely
the same manner as Wordsworth's herdsman's, because the
development of every individual mind is modified in some
measure by exterior conditions. Men may contemplate nature
from different points of view. Some may be impressed with one
aspect of nature, some with another. But none will fail to recognize
a mysterious <i>presence</i> and invisible <i>power</i> beneath all
the fleeting and changeful phenomena of the universe. "And
sometimes there are moments of tenderness, of sorrow, and of
vague mystery which bring the feeling of the Infinite Presence
close to the human heart."<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a>

<p>Now we hold that <i>this feeling and sentiment of the Divine</i>--the
supernatural--exists in every mind. It may be, it undoubtedly
is, somewhat modified in its manifestations by the circumstances
in which men are placed, and the degree of culture they
have enjoyed. The African Fetichist, in his moral and intellectual
debasement, conceives a supernatural power enshrined
in every object of nature. The rude Fijian regards with dread,
and even terror, the Being who darts the lightnings and wields
the thunderbolts. The Indian "sees God in clouds, and hears
him in the wind." The Scottish "herdsman" on the lonely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="120">120</a></span>
mountain-top "feels the presence and the power of greatness,"
and "in its fixed and steady lineaments he sees an ebbing and
a flowing mind." The philosopher<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a>
<a href="#footnote128"><sup class="sml">128</sup></a> lifts his eyes to "the starry
heavens" in all the depth of their concave, and with all their constellations
of glory moving on in solemn grandeur, and, to his
mind, these immeasurable regions seem "filled with the splendors
of the Deity, and crowded with the monuments of his
power;" or he turns his eye to "the Moral Law within," and he
hears the voice of an intelligent and a righteous God. In all
these cases we have a revelation of the sentiment of the Divine,
which dwells alike in all human minds. In the Athenians this
sentiment was developed in a high degree. The serene heaven
which Greece enjoyed, and which was the best-loved roof of its
inhabitants, the brilliant sun, the mountain scenery of unsurpassed
grandeur, the deep blue sea, an image of the infinite,
these poured all their fullness on the Athenian mind, and furnished
the most favorable conditions for the development of the
religious sentiments. The people of Athens spent most of their
time in the open air in communion with nature, and in the
cheerful and temperate enjoyment of existence. To recognize
the Deity in the living powers of nature, and especially in man,
as the highest sensible manifestation of the Divine, was the peculiar
prerogative of the Grecian mind. And here in Athens,
art also vied with nature to deepen the religious sentiments.
It raised the mind to ideal conceptions of a beauty and a sublimity
which transcended all mere nature-forms, and by images,
of supernatural grandeur and loveliness presented to the Athenians
symbolic representations of the separate attributes and operations
of the invisible God. The plastic art of Greece was
designed to express religious ideas, and was consecrated by religious
feeling. Thus the facts of the case are strikingly in harmony
with the words of the Apostle: "All things which I behold
bear witness to your carefulness in religion," your "reverence
for the Deity," your "fear of God."<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a>
<a href="#footnote129"><sup class="sml">129</sup></a> "The sacred objects" in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="121">121</a></span>
Athens, and especially "the altar to the Unknown God," were
all regarded by Paul as evidences of their instinctive faith in
the invisible, the supernatural, the divine.</p>

<p>Along with this sentiment of the Divine there is also associated,
in all human minds, an <i>instinctive yearning</i> after the Invisible;
not a mere feeling of curiosity to pierce the mystery of being
and of life, but what Paul designates "a feeling after God,"
which prompts man to seek after a deeper knowledge, and a
more immediate consciousness. To attain this deeper knowledge--this
more conscious realization of the being and the presence
of God, has been the effort of all philosophy and all religion
in all ages. The Hindoo Yogis proposes to withdraw into
his inmost self, and by a complete suspension of all his active
powers to become absorbed and swallowed up in the Infinite.<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a>
<a href="#footnote130"><sup class="sml">130</sup></a>
Plato and his followers sought by an immediate abstraction to
apprehend "the unchangeable and permanent Being," and, by
a loving contemplation, to become "assimilated to the Deity,"
and in this way to attain the immediate consciousness of God.
The Neo-Platonic mystic sought by asceticism and self-mortification
to prepare himself for divine communings. He would
contemplate the divine perfections in himself; and in an <i>ecstatic</i>
state, wherein all individuality vanishes, he would realize a union,
or identity, with the Divine Essence.<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a>
<a href="#footnote131"><sup class="sml">131</sup></a> While the universal
Church of God, indeed, has in her purest days always taught
that man may, by inward purity and a believing love, be rendered
capable of spiritually apprehending, and consciously feeling,
the presence of God. Some may be disposed to pronounce
this as all mere mysticism. We answer, The living internal
energy of religion is always <i>mystical</i>, it is grounded in
<i>feeling</i>--a "<i>sensus numinis</i>" common to humanity. It is the mysterious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="122" >122</a></span>
sentiment of the Divine; it is the prolepsis of the human spirit
reaching out towards the Infinite; the living susceptibility of our
spiritual nature stretching after the powers and influences of
the higher world. It is upon this inner instinct of the supernatural
that all religion rests. I do not say every religious idea,
but whatever is positive, practical, powerful, durable, and popular.
Everywhere, in all climates, in all epochs of history, and
in all degrees of civilization, man is animated by the sentiment--I
would rather say, the presentiment--that the world in which
he lives, the order of things in the midst of which he moves,
the facts which regularly and constantly succeed each other, are
not <i>all</i>. In vain he daily makes discoveries and conquests in
this vast universe; in vain he observes and learnedly verifies
the general laws which govern it; <i>his thought is not inclosed in
the world surrendered to his science</i>; the spectacle of it does not
suffice his soul, it is raised beyond it; it searches after and
catches glimpses of something beyond it; it aspires higher both
for the universe and itself; it aims at another destiny, another
master.</p>

<p>4. The Athenians had that deep consciousness of sin and
guilt, and of consequent liability to punishment, which confesses
the need of expiation by piacular sacrifices.</p>

<p>Every man feels himself to be an accountable being, and he
is conscious that in wrong-doing he is deserving of blame and
of punishment. Deep within the soul of the transgressor is the
consciousness that he is a guilty man, and he is haunted with
the perpetual apprehension of a retribution which, like the
spectre of evil omen, crosses his every path, and meets him at
every turn.</p>

<p class="i10">        And shapeless forms of fear."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Man does not possess this consciousness of guilt so much
as it holds possession of him. It pursues the fugitive from
justice, and it lays hold on the man who has resisted or escaped
the hand of the executioner. The sense of guilt is a
power over and above man; a power so wonderful that it often
compels the most reckless criminal to deliver himself up, with
the confession of his deed, to the sword of justice, when a falsehood
would have easily protected him. Man is only able by
persevering, ever-repeated efforts at self-induration, against the
remonstrances of conscience, to withdraw himself from its power.
His success is, however, but very partial; for sometimes,
in the moments of his greatest security, the reproaches of conscience
break in upon him like a flood, and sweep away all his
refuge of lies. "The evil conscience is the divine bond which
binds the created spirit, even in deep apostasy, to its Original.
In the consciousness of guilt there is revealed the essential relation
of our spirit to God, although misunderstood by man until
he has something higher than his evil conscience. The
trouble and anguish which the remonstrances of this consciousness
excite--the inward unrest which sometimes seizes the
slave of sin--are proofs that he has not quite broken away
from God."<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a>

<p>In Grecian mythology there was a very distinct recognition
of the power of conscience, and a reference of its authority to
the Divinity, together with the idea of retribution. Nemesis
was regarded as the impersonation of the upbraidings of conscience,
of the natural dread of punishment that springs up in
the human heart after the commission of sin. And as the
feeling of remorse may be considered as the consequence of
the displeasure and vengeance of an offended God, Nemesis
came to be regarded as the goddess of retribution, relentlessly
pursuing the guilty until she has driven them into irretrievable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="124">124</a></span>
woe and ruin. The Erinyes or Eumenides are the deities
whose business it is to punish, in hades, the crimes committed
upon earth. When an aggravated crime has excited their displeasure
they manifest their greatest power in the disquietude
of conscience.</p>

<p>Along with this deep consciousness of guilt, and this fear of
retribution which haunts the guilty mind, there has also rested
upon the heart of universal humanity a deep and abiding
conviction that <i>something must be done to expiate the guilt of
sin</i>--some restitution must be made, some suffering must be
endured,<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a>
<a href="#footnote135"><sup class="sml">135</sup></a> some sacrifice offered to atone for past misdeeds.
Hence it is that men in all ages have had recourse to penances
and prayers, to self-inflicted tortures and costly sacrifices to
appease a righteous anger which their sins had excited, and
avert an impending punishment. That sacrifice to atone for
sin has prevailed universally--that it has been practised "<i>sem-per,
ubique, et ab omnibus,</i>" always, in all places, and by all men--will
not be denied by the candid and competent inquirer.
The evidence which has been collected from ancient history by
Grotius and Magee, and the additional evidence from contemporaneous
history, which is being now furnished by the researches
of ethnologists and Christian missionaries, is conclusive.
No intelligent man can doubt the fact. Sacrificial offerings
have prevailed in every nation and in every age. "Almost
the entire worship of the pagan nations consisted in rites
of deprecation. Fear of the Divine displeasure seems to have
been the leading feature of their religious impressions; and in
the diversity, the costliness, the cruelty of their sacrifices they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="125" >125</a></span>
sought to appease gods to whose wrath they felt themselves
exposed, from a consciousness of sin, unrelieved by any information
as to the means of escaping its effects."<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a>

<p>It must be known to every one at all acquainted with Greek
mythology that the idea of <i>expiation</i>--atonement--was a fundamental
idea of their religion. Independent of any historical
research, a very slight glance at the Greek and Roman classics,
especially the poets, who were the theologians of that age, can
leave little doubt upon this head.<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a>
<a href="#footnote137"><sup class="sml">137</sup></a> Their language everywhere
announces the notion of <i>propitiation</i>, and, particularly the Latin,
furnishes the terms which are still employed in theology. We
need only mention the words ἱλασµός, ἱλάσκοµαι, λύτρον, περίψηµα,
as examples from the Greek, and <i>placare, propitiare, expiare,
piaculum</i>, from the Latin. All these indicate that the notion of
expiation was interwoven into the very modes of thought and
framework of the language of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote137"
name="footnote137"><b>Footnote 137: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag137">
(return) </a> In Homer the doctrine is expressly taught that the gods may, and sometimes
do, remit the penalty, when duly propitiated by prayers and sacrifices
accompanied by suitable reparations ("Iliad," ix. 497 sqq.). "We have a
practical illustration of this doctrine in the first book of the Iliad, where
Apollo averts the pestilence from the army, when the daughter of his priest
is returned without ransom, and a <i>sacrifice</i> (ἑλατόµßη) is sent to the altar of
the god at sacred Chrysa.... Apollo hearkens to the intercession of his
priest, accepts the sacred hecatomb, is delighted with the accompanying
songs and libations, and sends back the embassy with a favoring breeze,
and a favorable answer to the army, who meanwhile had been <i>purifying</i>
(ἀπελυµαίνοντο) themselves, and offering unblemished hecatombs of bulls
and goats on the shore of the sea which washes the place of their encampment."

<p>"The object of the propitiatory embassy to Apollo is thus stated by
Ulysses: Agamemnon, king of men, has sent me to bring back thy daughter
Chryses, and to offer a sacred hecatomb for (ὑπέρ) the Greeks, that we may
<i>propitiate</i> (ιλασόµεσθα) the king, who now sends woes and many groans upon
the Argives" (442 sqq.).--Tyler, "Theology of Greek Poets," pp. 196, 197.</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not deem it needful to discuss at length the question
which has been so earnestly debated among theologians,
as to whether the idea of expiation be a primitive and necessary
idea of the human mind, or whether the practice of piacular
sacrifices came into the post-diluvian world with Noah, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="126" >126</a></span>
positive institution of a primitive religion then first directly instituted
by God. On either hypothesis the practice of expiatory
rites derives its authority from God; in the latter case, by
an outward and verbal revelation, in the former by an inward
and intuitive revelation.</p>

<p>This much, however, must be conceded on all hands, that
there are certain fundamental intuitions, universal and necessary,
which underlie the almost universal practice of expiatory
sacrifice, namely, <i>the universal consciousness of guilt, and the
universal conviction that something must be done to expiate guilt</i>,
to compensate for wrong, and to atone for past misdeeds. But
<i>how</i> that expiation can be effected, how that atonement can be
made, is a question which reason does not seem competent to
answer. That personal sin can be atoned for by vicarious
suffering, that national guilt can be expiated and national punishment
averted by animal sacrifices, or even by human sacrifices,
is repugnant to rather than conformable with natural reason.
There exists no discernible connection between the one
and the other. We may suppose that eucharistic, penitential,
and even deprecatory sacrifices may have originated in the
light of nature and reason, but we are unable to account for
the practice of piacular sacrifices for substitutional atonement,
on the same principle. The ethical principle, that one's own
sins are not transferable either in their guilt or punishment, is
so obviously just that we feel it must have been as clear to the
mind of the Greek who brought his victim to be offered to Zeus,
as it is to the philosophic mind of to-day.<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a>
<a href="#footnote138"><sup class="sml">138</sup></a> The knowledge
that the Divine displeasure can be averted by sacrifice is not,
by Plato, grounded upon any intuition of reason, as is the existence
of God, the idea of the true, the just, and good, but on

<p>The origin of expiatory sacrifices can not, we think, be explained
except on the principle of a primitive revelation and
a positive appointment of God. They can not be understood
except as a divinely-appointed symbolism, in which there is
exhibited a confession of personal guilt and desert of punishment;
an intimation and a hope that God will be propitious
and merciful; and a typical promise and prophecy of a future
Redeemer from sin, who shall "put away sin by the sacrifice
of himself." This sacred rite was instituted in connection with
the <i>protevangelium</i> given to our first parents; it was diffused
among the nations by tradition, and has been kept alive as a
general, and, indeed, almost universal observance, by that deep
sense of sin, and consciousness of guilt, and personal urgency
of the need of a reconciliation, which are so clearly displayed
in Grecian mythology.</p>

<p>The legitimate inference we find ourselves entitled to draw
from the words of Paul, when fairly interpreted in the light of
the past religious history of the world, is, that the Athenians
were a religious people; that is, <i>they were, however unknowing,
believers in and worshippers of the One Supreme God</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="128" >128</a></span>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE ATHENIANS: ITS MYTHOLOGICAL AND
SYMBOLICAL ASPECTS.</h3>

<blockquote>
"That there is one Supreme Deity, both philosophers and poets, and even
the vulgar worshippers of the gods themselves frequently acknowledge;
which because the assertors of gods well understood, they affirm these gods
of theirs to preside over the several parts of the world, yet so that there is
only one chief governor. Whence it follows, that all their other gods can be
no other than ministers and officers which one greatest God, who is omnipotent,
hath variously appointed, and constituted so as to serve his command."
--LACTANTIUS.
</blockquote>

<p>The conclusion reached in the previous chapter that the
Athenians were believers in and worshippers of the One
Supreme God, has been challenged with some considerable
show of reason and force, on the ground that they were <i>Polytheists</i>
and <i>Idolaters</i>.</p>

<p>An objection which presents itself so immediately on the
very face of the sacred narrative, and which is sustained by the
unanimous voice of history, is entitled to the fullest consideration.
And as the interests of truth are infinitely more precious
than the maintenance of any theory, however plausible, we are
constrained to accord to this objection the fullest weight, and
give to it the most impartial consideration. We can not do
otherwise than at once admit that the Athenians were <i>Polytheists</i>--they
worshipped "many gods" besides "the unknown
God." It is equally true that they were <i>Idolaters</i>--they worshipped
images or statues of the gods, which images were also,
by an easy metonymy, called "gods."</p>

<p>But surely no one supposes that this is all that can be said
upon the subject, and that, after such admissions, the discussion
must be closed. On the contrary, we have, as yet, scarce
caught a glimpse of the real character and genius of Grecian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="129">129</a></span>
polytheistic worship, and we have not made the first approach
towards a philosophy of Grecian mythology.</p>

<p>The assumption that the heathen regarded the images
"graven by art and device of man" as the real creators of the
world and man, or as having any control over the destinies of
men, sinks at once under the weight of its own absurdity. Such
hypothesis is repudiated with scorn and indignation by the heathens
themselves. Cotta, in <i>Cicero</i>, declares explicitly: "though
it be common and familiar language amongst us to call corn
Ceres, and wine Bacchus, yet who can think any one so mad
as to take that to be really a god that he feeds upon?"<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a>
<a href="#footnote141"><sup class="sml">141</sup></a> And
<i>Plutarch</i> condemns the whole practice of giving the names of
gods and goddesses to inanimate objects, as absurd, impious,
and atheistical: "they who give the names of gods to senseless
matter and inanimate things, and such as are destroyed by
men in the using, beget most wicked and atheistical opinions
in the minds of men, since it can not be conceived how these
things should be gods, for nothing that is inanimate is a god."<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a>
<a href="#footnote142"><sup class="sml">142</sup></a>
And so also the Hindoo, the Buddhist, the American Indian, the
Fijian of to-day, repel the notion that their visible images are
real gods, or that they worship them instead of the unseen God.</p>

<p>And furthermore, that even the invisible divinities which
these images were designed to represent, were each independent,
self-existent beings, and that the stories which are told
concerning them by Homer and Hesiod were received in a
literal sense, is equally improbable. The earliest philosophers
knew as well as we know, that the Deity, in order to be Deity,
must be either <i>perfect</i> or nothing--that he must be <i>one</i>, not
many--without parts and passions; and they were scandalized
and shocked by the religious fables of the ancient mythology
as much as we are. <i>Xenophanes</i>, who lived, as we know, before
Pythagoras, accuses Homer and Hesiod of having ascribed to
the gods every thing that is disgraceful amongst men, as stealing,
adultery, and deceit. He remarks "that men seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="130">130</a></span>
created their gods, and to have given them their own mind, and
voice, and figure." He himself declares that "God is <i>one,</i> the
greatest amongst gods and men, neither in form nor in thought
like unto men." He calls the battles of the Titans and the
Giants, and the Centaurs, "the inventions of former generations,"
and he demands that God shall be praised in holy
songs and nobler strains.<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a>
<a href="#footnote143"><sup class="sml">143</sup></a> Diogenes Laertius relates the
following of <i>Pythagoras</i>, "that when he descended to the shades
below, he saw the soul of Hesiod bound to a pillar of brass
and gnashing his teeth; and that of Homer, as suspended on
a tree, and surrounded by serpents; as a punishment for the
things they had said of the gods."<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a>
<a href="#footnote144"><sup class="sml">144</sup></a> These poets, who had
corrupted theology, <i>Plato</i> proposes to exclude from his ideal
Republic; or if permitted at all, they must be subjected to a rigid
expurgation. "We shall," says he, "have to repudiate a large
part of those fables which are now in vogue; and, especially,
of what I call the greater fables,--the stories which Hesiod and
Homer tell us. In these stories there is a fault which deserves
the gravest condemnation; namely, when an author gives a
<i>bad representation of gods and heroes</i>. We must condemn such
a poet, as we should condemn a painter, whose pictures bear no
resemblance to the objects which he tries to imitate. For instance,
the poet Hesiod related an ugly story when he told how
Uranus acted, and how Kronos had his revenge upon him.
They are offensive stories, and must not be repeated in our
cities. Not yet is it proper to say, in any case,--what is indeed
untrue--that gods wage war against gods, and intrigue and
fight among themselves. Stories like the chaining of Juno
by her son Vulcan, and the flinging of Vulcan out of heaven
for trying to take his mother's part when his father was beating
her, and all other battles of the gods which are found in Homer,
must be refused admission into our state, <i>whether they are allegorical
or not</i>. For a child can not discriminate between what
is allegorical and what is not; and whatever is adopted, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="131" >131</a></span>
matter of belief, in childhood, has a tendency to become fixed
and indelible; and therefore we ought to esteem it as of the
greatest importance that the fables which children first hear
should be adapted, as far as possible, to promote virtue."<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a>

<p>If, then, poetic and allegorical representations of divine
things are to be permitted in the ideal republic, then the founders
of the state are to prescribe "the moulds in which the poets
are to cast their fictions."</p>

<p>"Now what are these moulds to be in the case of <i>Theology?</i>
They may be described as follows: It is right always to represent
God as he really is, whether the poet describe him in an
epic, or a lyric, or a dramatic poem. Now God is, beyond all
else, <i>good in reality</i>, and therefore so to be represented. But
nothing that is good is hurtful. That which is good hurts not;
does no evil; is the cause of no evil. That which is good is
beneficial; is the cause of good. And, therefore, that which
is good is not the cause of <i>all</i> which is and happens, but only
of that which is as it should be.... The good things we must
ascribe to God, whilst we must seek elsewhere, and not in him,
the causes of evil things."</p>

<p>We must, then, express our disapprobation of Homer, or any
other poet, who is guilty of such a foolish blunder as to tell us
(Iliad, xxiv. 660) that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">'Fast by the threshold of Jove's court are placed</p>

<p>And if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties
by the act of Pandarus was brought about by Athené and Zeus
(Iliad, ii. 60), we should refuse our approbation. Nor can
we allow it to be said that the strife and trial of strength between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="132">132</a></span>
the gods (Iliad, xx.) was instigated by Themis and

<p>It is an obvious truth, attested by the voice of universal
consciousness as revealed in history, that the human mind can
never rest satisfied within the sphere of sensible phenomena.
Man is impelled by an inward necessity to pass, in thought,
beyond the boundary-line of sense, and inquire after causes
and entities which his reason assures him must lie beneath all
sensible appearances. He must and will interpret nature according
to the forms of his own personality, or according to the
fundamental ideas of his own reason. In the childlike subjectivity
of the undisciplined mind he will either transfer to nature
the phenomena of his own personality, regarding the world
as a living organism which has within it an informing soul, and
thus attain a <i>pantheistic</i> conception of the universe; or else he
will fix upon some extraordinary and inexplicable phenomenon
of nature, and, investing it with <i>super</i>natural significance, will
rise from thence to a religious and <i>theocratic</i> conception of nature
as a whole. An intelligence--a mind <i>within</i> nature, and
inseparable from nature, or else <i>above</i> nature and governing
nature, is, for man, an inevitable thought.</p>

<p>It is equally obvious that humanity can never relegate itself
from a supernatural origin, neither can it ever absolve itself
from a permanent correlation with the Divine. Man feels
within him an instinctive nobility. He did not arise out of the
bosom of nature; in some mysterious way he has descended
from an eternal mind, he is "the offspring of God." And furthermore,
a theocratic conception of nature, associated with a
pre-eminent regard for certain apparently supernatural experiences
in the history of humanity, becomes the foundation of
governments, of civil authority, and of laws. Society can not
be founded without the aid of the Deity, and a commonwealth
can only be organized by Divine interposition. "A Ceres
must appear and sow the fields with corn." And a Numa or
a Lycurgus must be heralded by the oracle as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Dear to Jove, and all who sit in the halls of the Olympus."</p>
</div></div>

<p>He must be a "descendant of Zeus," appointed by the gods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="134" >134</a></span>
to rule, and one who will "prove himself a god." These divinely-appointed
rulers were regarded as the ministers of God,
the visible representatives of the unseen Power which really
governs all. The divine government must also have its invisible
agents--its Nemesis, and Themis, and Diké, the ministers
of law, of justice, and of retribution; and its Jupiter, and Juno,
and Neptune, and Pluto, ruling, with delegated powers, in the
heavens, the air, the sea, and the nethermost regions. So that,
in fact, there exists no nation, no commonwealth, no history
without a Theophany, and along with it certain sacred legends
detailing the origin of the people, the government, the country
itself, and the world at large. This is especially true of India,
Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Their primitive history is eminently
<i>mythological</i>.</p>

<p>Grecian polytheism can not be otherwise regarded than as
a poetico-historical religion of <i>myth</i> and <i>symbol</i> which is under-laid
by a natural Theism; a parasitical growth which winds
itself around the original stem of instinctive faith in a supernatural
Power and Presence which pervades the universe.
The myths are oral traditions, floating down from that dim;
twilight of <i>poetic</i> history, which separates real history, with its
fixed chronology, from the unmeasured and unrecorded eternity--faint
echoes from that mystic border-land which divides
the natural from the supernatural, and in which they seem to
have been marvellously commingled. They are the lingering
memories of those manifestations of God to men, in which he
or his celestial ministers came into visible intercourse with our
race; the reality of which is attested by sacred history. In
all these myths there is a theogonic and cosmogonic element.
They tell of the generation of the celestial and aërial divinities--the
subordinate agents and ministers of the Divine government.
They attempt an explanation of the genesis of the visible
universe, the origin of humanity, and the development of
human society. In the presence of history, the substance of
these myths is preserved by <i>symbols</i>, that is, by means of natural
or artificial, real or striking objects, which, by some analogy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="135">135</a></span>
or arbitrary association, shall suggest the <i>idea</i> to the mind.
These symbols were designed to represent the invisible attributes
and operations of the Deity; the powers that vitalize
nature, that control the elements, that preside over cities, that
protect the nations: indeed, all the agencies of the physical
and moral government of God. Beneath all the pagan legends
of gods, and underlying all the elaborate mechanism of pagan
worship, there are unquestionably philosophical ideas, and theological
conceptions, and religious sentiments, which give as
meaning, and even a mournful grandeur to the whole.</p>

<p>Whilst the pagan polytheistic worship is, under one aspect,
to be regarded as a departure from God, inasmuch as it takes
away the honor due to God alone, and transfers it to the creature;
still, under another aspect, we can not fail to recognize
in it the effort of the human mind to fill up the chasm that
seemed, to the undisciplined mind, to separate God and man--and
to bridge the gulf between the visible and the invisible,
the finite and the infinite. It was unquestionably an attempt
to bring God nearer to the sense and comprehension of man.
It had its origin in that instinctive yearning after the supernatural,
the Divine, which dwells in all human hearts, and
which has revealed itself in all philosophies, mysticisms, and
religions.<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a>
<a href="#footnote150"><sup class="sml">150</sup></a> This longing was stimulated by the contemplation
of the living beauty and grandeur of the visible universe, which,
to the lively fancy and deep feeling of the Greeks, seemed as
the living vesture of the Infinite Mind,--the temple of the eternal
Deity. In this visible universe the Divinity was partly revealed,
and partly concealed. The unity of the all-pervading
Intelligence was veiled beneath an apparent diversity of power,
and a manifoldness of operations. They caught some glimpses
of this universal presence in nature, but were more immediately
and vividly impressed by the several manifestations of the divine
perfections and divine operations, as so many separate
rays of the Divinity, or so many subordinate agents and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="136">136</a></span>
functionaries employed to execute the will and carry out the purposes
of the Supreme Mind.<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a>
<a href="#footnote151"><sup class="sml">151</sup></a> That unseen, incomprehensible
Power and Presence was perceived in the sublimity of the deep
blue sky, the energy of the vitalizing sun, the surging of the
sea, the rushing wind, the roaring thunder, the ripening corn,
and the clustering vine. To these separate manifestations of
the Deity they gave <i>personal names</i>, as Jupiter to the heavens,
Juno to the air, Neptune to the sea, Ceres to the corn, and
Bacchus to the vine. These personals denoted, not the things
themselves, but the invisible, divine powers supposed to preside
over those several departments of nature. By a kind of
prosopopœia "they spake of the things in nature, and parts of
the world, as persons--and consequently as so many gods and
goddesses--yet so as the intelligent might easily understand
their meaning, <i>that these were in reality nothing else but so many
names and notions of that one Numen,--divine force and power
which runs through all the world, multiformly displaying itself.</i>"<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a>
<a href="#footnote152"><sup class="sml">152</sup></a>
"Their various deities were but different names, different conceptions,
of that Incomprehensible Being which no <i>thought</i> can
reach, and no <i>language</i> express."<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a>
<a href="#footnote153"><sup class="sml">153</sup></a> Having given to these several
manifestations of the Divinity personal names, they now
sought to represent them to the eye of sense by <i>visible forms</i>,
as the symbols or images of the perfections of the unseen, the
incomprehensible, the unknown God. And as the Greeks regarded
man as the first and noblest among the phenomena of
nature, they selected the human form as the highest sensible
manifestation of God, the purest symbol of the Divinity. Grecian

polytheism was thus a species of <i>mythical anthropomorphism</i>.</p>

<p>A philosophy of Grecian mythology, such as we have outlined
in the preceding paragraphs, is, in our judgment, perfectly
consistent with the views announced by Paul in his address to
the Athenians. He intimates that the Athenians "thought that
the Godhead was <i>like unto</i> (ἐ ναι ὄµοιον)--to be imaged or represented
by human art--by gold, and silver, and precious stone
graven by art, and device of man;" that is, they thought the
perfections of God could be represented to the eye by an image,
or symbol. The views of Paul are still more articulately
expressed in Romans, i. 23, 25: "They changed the glory of
the incorruptible God into the <i>similitude of an image</i> of corruptible
man,.... and they worshipped and served the thing made,
παρά--<i>rather</i> than, or <i>more</i> than the Creator." Here, then, the
apostle intimates, first, that the heathen <i>knew</i> God,<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a>
<a href="#footnote154"><sup class="sml">154</sup></a> and that
they worshipped God. They worshipped the creature besides or
even more than God, but still they also worshipped God. And,
secondly, they represented the perfections of God by an image,
and under this, as a "<i>likeness</i>" or symbol, they indirectly worshipped
God. Their religious system was, then, even to the
eye of Paul, a <i>symbolic</i> worship--that is, the objects of their devotion
were the <i>ὁµοιώµατα</i>--the similitudes, the likenesses, the
images of the perfections of the invisible God.</p>

<p>It is at once conceded by us, that the "sensus numinis," the
natural intuition of a Supreme Mind, whose power and presence
are revealed in nature, can not maintain itself, as an influential,
and vivifying, and regulative belief amongst men, without
the continual supernatural interposition of God; that is,
without a succession of Divine revelations. And further, we
grant that, instead of this symbolic mode of worship deepening
and vitalizing the sense of God as a living power and presence,
there is great danger that the symbol shall at length unconsciously
take the place of God, and be worshipped instead of
Him. From the purest form of symbolism which prevailed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="138" >138</a></span>
the earliest ages, there may be an inevitable descent to the
rudest form of false worship, with its accompanying darkness,
and abominations, and crimes; but, at the same time, let us
do justice to the religions of the ancient world--the childhood
stammerings of religious life--which were something more than
the inventions of designing men, or the mere creations of human
fancy; they were, in the words of Paul, "a <i>seeking after
God</i>, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, who is
not far from any one of us." It can not be denied that the
more thoughtful and intelligent Greeks regarded the visible
objects of their devotion as mere symbols of the perfections
and operations of the unseen God, and of the invisible powers
and subordinate agencies which are employed by him in his
providential and moral government of the world. And whatever
there was of misapprehension and of "ignorance" in the
popular mind, we have the assurance of Paul that it was "<i>overlooked</i>"
by God.</p>

<p>The views here presented will, we venture to believe, be
found most in harmony with a true philosophy of the human
mind; with the religious phenomena of the world; and, as we
shall subsequently see, with the writings of those poets and
philosophers who may be fairly regarded as representing the
sentiments and opinions of the ancient world. At the same
time, we have no desire to conceal the fact that this whole
question as to the origin, and character, and philosophy of the
mythology and symbolism of the religions of the ancient world
has been a subject of earnest controversy from Patristic times
down to the present hour, and that even to-day there exists a
wide diversity of opinion among philosophers, as well as theologians.</p>

<p>The principal theories offered may be classed as the <i>ethical</i>,
the <i>physical</i>, and the <i>historical</i>, according to the different objects
the framers of the myths are supposed to have had in view.
Some have regarded the myths as invented by the priests and
wise men of old for the improvement and government of society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="139">139</a></span>
as designed to give authority to laws, and maintain social
order.<a id="footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a>
<a href="#footnote155"><sup class="sml">155</sup></a> Others have regarded them as intended to be allegorical
interpretations of physical phenomena--the poetic embodiment
of the natural philosophy of the primitive races of men;<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a>
<a href="#footnote156"><sup class="sml">156</sup></a>
whilst others have looked upon them as historical legends,
having a substratum of fact, and, when stripped of the supernatural
and miraculous drapery which accompanies fable, as
containing the history of primitive times.<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a>
<a href="#footnote157"><sup class="sml">157</sup></a> Some of the latter
class have imagined they could recognize in Grecian mythology
traces of sacred personages, as well as profane; in fact,
a dimmed image of the patriarchal traditions which are preserved
in the Old Testament scriptures.<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a>
<a href="#footnote158"><sup class="sml">158</sup></a></p>

<p>It is beyond our design to discuss all the various theories
presented, or even to give a history of opinions entertained.<a id="footnotetag159" name="footnotetag159"></a>
<a href="#footnote159"><sup class="sml">159</sup></a>
We are fully convinced that the hypothesis we have presented in
the preceding pages, viz., <i>that Grecian mythology was a grand
symbolic representation of the Divine as manifested in nature and
providence</i>, is the only hypothesis which meets and harmonizes
all the facts of the case. This is the theory of Plato, of Cudworth,
Baumgarten, Max Müller, and many other distinguished
scholars.</p>

with the classic and patristic literature of this deeply interesting subject,
we commend the careful study of Cudworth's "Intellectual System
of the Universe," especially ch. iv. The style of Cudworth is perplexingly
involved, and his great work is unmethodical in its arrangement and discussion.
Nevertheless, the patient and persevering student will be amply rewarded
for his pains. A work of more profound research into the doctrine
of antiquity concerning God, and into the real import of the religious systems
of the ancient world, is, probably, not extant in any language.</blockquote>

<p>There are two fundamental propositions laid down by Cudworth
which constitute the basis of this hypothesis.</p>

<p>1. <i>No well-authenticated instance can be furnished from among
the Greek Polytheists of one who taught the existence of a multiplicity
of independenty uncreated, self-existent deities; they almost universally</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="140" >140</a></span>
<i>believed in the existence of</i> ONE SUPREME, UNCREATED, ETERNAL
GOD, "<i>The Maker of all things</i>"--"<i>the Father of gods and men</i>,"
--"<i>the sole Monarch and Ruler of the world</i>."</p>

<p>2. <i>The Greek Polytheists taught a plurality of</i> "GENERATED
DEITIES," <i>who owe their existence to the power and will of the
Supreme God, who are by Him invested with delegated powers,
and who, as the agents of his universal providence, preside over
different departments of the created universe</i>.</p>

<p>The evidence presented by Cudworth in support of his theses
is so varied and so voluminous, that it defies all attempts at
condensation. His volumes exhibit an extent of reading, of
patient research, and of varied learning, which is truly amazing.
The discussion of these propositions involves, in fact, nothing
less than a complete and exhaustive survey of the entire field
of ancient literature, a careful study of the Greek and Latin
poets, of the Oriental, Greek, and Alexandrian philosophers, and
a review of the statements and criticisms of Rabbinical and
Patristic writers in regard to the religions of the pagan world.
An adequate conception of the varied and weighty evidence
which is collected by our author from these fields, in support
of his views, could only be conveyed by transcribing to our
pages the larger portion of his memorable <i>fourth</i> chapter. But
inasmuch as Grecian polytheism is, in fact, the culmination of
all the mythological systems of the ancient world, the fully-developed
flower and ripened fruit of the cosmical and theological
conceptions of the childhood-condition of humanity, we propose
to epitomize the results of his inquiry as to the <i>theological</i>,
opinions of the Greeks, supplying additional confirmation of his
views from other sources.</p>

<p>And first, he proves most conclusively that Orpheus, Homer,
and Hesiod,<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a>
<a href="#footnote160"><sup class="sml">160</sup></a> who are usually designated "the theologians"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="141">141</a></span>
of Greece, but who were in fact the depravers and corrupters of
pagan theology, do not teach the existence of a multitude of
<i>unmade, self-existent, and independent deities</i>. Even they believed
in the existence of <i>one</i> uncreated and eternal mind, <i>one Supreme
God</i>, anterior and superior to all the gods of their mythology.
They had some intuition, some apperception of the <i>Divine</i>, even
before they had attached to it a sacred name. The gods of
their mythology had all, save one, a temporal origin; they were
generated of Chaos and Night, by an active principle called
<i>Love</i>. "One might suspect," says Aristotle, that Hesiod, and
if there be any other who made <i>love</i> or <i>desire</i> a principle of
things, aimed at these very things (viz., the designation of the
efficient cause of the world); for Parmenides, describing the
generation of the universe, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">    'First of all the gods planned he <i>love</i>;'</p>
</div></div>

<p>and further, Hesiod:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">         'First of all was Chaos, afterwards Earth,</p>
<p class="i10">         With her spacious bosom,</p>
<p class="i10">         And <i>Love</i>, who is pre-eminent among all the immortals;'</p>
</div></div>

<p>as intimating here that in entities there should exist some <i>cause</i>
that will impart motion, and hold bodies in union together.
But how, in regard to these, one ought to distribute them, as
to the order of priority, can be decided afterwards.<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a>
<a href="#footnote161"><sup class="sml">161</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote160"

(return) </a> We do not concern ourselves with the chronological antecedence of
these ancient Greek poets. It is of little consequence to us whether Homer
preceded Orpheus, or Orpheus Homer. They were not the real creators of
the mythology of ancient Greece. The myths were a spontaneous growth
of the earliest human thought even before the separation of the Aryan family
into its varied branches.

<p>The study of Comparative Mythology, as well as of Comparative Language,
assures us that the myths had an origin much earlier than the times
of Homer and Orpheus. They floated down from ages on the tide of oral
tradition before they were systematized, embellished, and committed to writing
by Homer, and Orpheus, and Hesiod. And between the systems of these
three poets a perceptible difference is recognizable, which reflects the changes
that verbal recitations necessarily and imperceptibly undergo.</blockquote>

<p>Now whether this "first principle," called "<i>Love</i>," "the
cause of motion and of union" in the universe, was regarded as
a personal Being, and whether, as the ancient scholiast taught,
Hesiod's love was "the heavenly Love, which is also God, that
other love that was born of Venus being junior," is just now of
no moment to the argument. The more important inference is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="142">142</a></span>
that amongst the gods of Pagan theology but <i>one</i> is self-existent,
or else none are. Because the Hesiodian gods, which are, in fact,
all the gods of the Greek mythology, "were either all of them
derived from chaos, love itself likewise being generated out of
it; or else love was supposed to be distinct from chaos, and
the active principle of the universe, from whence, together with
chaos, all the theogony and cosmogony was derived."<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a>
<a href="#footnote162"><sup class="sml">162</sup></a> Hence
it is evident the poets did not teach the existence of a multiplicity

<p>The careful reader of Cudworth will also learn another truth
of the utmost importance in this connection, viz., <i>that the theogony
of the Greek poets was, in fact, a cosmogony</i>, the generation
of the gods being, in reality, the generation of the heavens, the
sun, the moon, the stars, and all the various powers and phenomena
of nature. This is dimly shadowed forth in the very
names which are given to some of these divinities. Thus Helios
is the sun, Selena is the moon, Zeus the sky--the deep
blue heaven, Eos the dawn, and Ersē the dew. It is rendered
still more evident by the opening lines of Hesiod's "Theogonia,"
in which he invokes the muses:</p>

<p>Where we see plainly that the generation of the gods is the
generation of the earth, the heaven, the stars, the seas, the rivers,
and other things produced by them. "But immediately
after invocation of the Muses the poet begins with Chaos, and
Tartara, and Love, as the first principles, and then proceeds to
the production of the earth and of night out of chaos; of the
ether and of day, from night; of the starry heavens, mountains,
and seas. All which generation of gods is really nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="143">143</a></span>
a poetic description of the cosmogonia; as through the sequel
of the poem all seems to be physiology veiled under fiction
and allegory.... Hesiod's gods are thus not only the animated
parts of the world, but also the other things of nature
personified and deified, or abusively called gods and goddesses."<a id="footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a>
<a href="#footnote163"><sup class="sml">163</sup></a>
The same is true both of the Orphic and Homeric gods.
"Their generation of the gods is the same with the generation
or creation of the world, both of them having, in all probability,
derived it from the Mosaic cabala, or tradition."<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a>
<a href="#footnote164"><sup class="sml">164</sup></a></p>

<p>But in spite of all this mythological obscuration, the belief
in one Supreme God is here and there most clearly recognizable.
"That Zeus was originally to the Greeks the Supreme
God, the true God--nay, at some time their only God--can be
perceived in spite of the haze which mythology has raised
around his name."<a id="footnotetag165" name="footnotetag165"></a>
<a href="#footnote165"><sup class="sml">165</sup></a> True, they sometimes used the word
"Zeus" in a physical sense to denote the deep expanse of heaven,
and sometimes in a historic sense, to designate a hero or
deified man said to have been born in Crete. It is also true
that the Homeric Zeus is full of contradictions. He is "all-seeing,"
yet he is cheated; he is "omnipotent," yet he is defied;
he is "eternal," yet he has a father; he is "just," yet he is
guilty of crime. Now, as Müller very justly remarks, these contradictions
may teach us a lesson. If all the conceptions of
Zeus had sprung from one origin, these contradictions could
not have existed. If Zeus had simply and only meant the Supreme
God, he could not have been the son of Kronos (Time).
If, on the other hand, Zeus had been a mere mythological personage,
as Eos, the dawn, and Helios, the sun, he could never
have been addressed as he is addressed in the famous prayer
of Achilles (Iliad, bk. xxi.).<a id="footnotetag166" name="footnotetag166"></a>

<p>In Homer there is a perpetual blending of the natural and
the supernatural, the human and divine. The <i>Iliad</i> is an incongruous
medley of theology, physics, and history. In its
gorgeous scenic representations, nature, humanity, and deity are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="144">144</a></span>
mingled in inextricable confusion. The gods are sometimes
supernatural and superhuman personages; sometimes the
things and powers of nature personified; and sometimes they
are deified men. And yet there are passages, even in Homer,
which clearly distinguish Zeus from all the other divinities,
and mark him out as the Supreme. He is "the highest, first
of Gods" (bk. xix. 284); "most great, most glorious Jove"
(bk. ii. 474). He is "the universal Lord" (bk. xi. 229); "of
mortals and immortals king supreme," (bk. xii. 263); "over
all the immortal gods he reigns in unapproached pre-eminence
of power" (bk. xv. 125). He is "the King of kings" (bk. viii.
35), whose "will is sovereign" (bk. iv. 65), and his "power
invincible" (bk. viii. 35). He is the "eternal Father" (bk.
viii. 77). He "excels in wisdom gods and men; all human
things from him proceed" (bk. xiii. 708-10); "the Lord of
counsel" (bk. i. 208), "the all-seeing Jove" (bk. xiii. 824). Indeed
the mere expression "Father of gods and men" (bk. i.
639), so often applied to Zeus, and him <i>alone</i>, is proof sufficient
that, in spite of all the legendary stories of gods and heroes, the
idea of Zeus as the Supreme God, the maker of the world, the
Father of gods and men, the monarch and ruler of the world,
was not obliterated from the Greek mind.<a id="footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a>

Uranos, but in the order of Grecian conception Zeus is the prominent person,
and Kronos and Uranos are inferior and introductory precursors, set up
in order to be overthrown, and to serve as mementos of the powers of their
conqueror. To Homer and Hesiod, as well as to the Greeks universally,
Zeus is the great, the predominant God, 'the Father of gods and men,'
whose power none of the gods can hope to resist, or even deliberately think
of questioning. All the other gods have their specific potency, and peculiar
sphere of action and duty, with which Zeus does not usually interfere; but
it is he who maintains the lineaments of a providential government, as well
over the phenomena of Olympus as over the earth."--Grote, "Hist. of

the righteous works of men' (Od. xiv. 83). His whole life is

grinding corn in the house of Ulysses is religious in the truest
sense--'Father Zeus, thou who rulest over gods and men, surely
thou hast just thundered in the starry sky, and there is no
cloud anywhere. Thou showest this as a sign to some one.

<p>Now it is unquestionable that, with the tragedians, Zeus is
the Supreme God. Æschylus is pre-eminently the theological
poet of Greece. The great problems which lie at the foundation
of religious faith and practice are the main staple of nearly
all his tragedies. Homer, Hesiod, the sacred poets, had
looked at these questions in their purely poetic aspects. The
subsequent philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, developed them
more fully by their didactic method. Æschylus stands on the
dividing-line between them, no less poetic than the former,
scarcely less philosophical than the latter, but more intensely
practical, personal, and <i>theological</i> than either. The character
of the Supreme Divinity, as represented in his tragedies, approaches
more nearly to the Christian idea of God. He is
the Universal Father--Father of gods and men; the Universal
Cause (παναίτιος, Agamem. 1485); the All-seer and All-doer
(παντόπτης, πανεργέτης, ibid, and Sup. 139); the All-wise and
All-controlling (παγκρατής, Sup. 813); the Just and the Executor
of justice (δικηφόρος, Agamem. 525); true and incapable of
falsehood (Prom. 1031);</p>

<p>It has been urged that, as Zeus means the sky, therefore he
is no more than the deep concave of heaven personified and
deified, and that consequently Zeus is not the true, the only
God. This argument is only equalled in feebleness by that of
the materialist, who argues that "spiritus" means simply breath,
therefore the breath is the soul. Even if the Greeks remembered
that, originally, Zeus meant the sky, that would have no more
perplexed their minds than the remembrance that "thymos"--mind--meant
originally blast. "The fathers of Greek theology
gave to that Supreme Intelligence, which they instinctively recognized
as above and ruling over the universe, the name of
Zeus; but in doing so, they knew well that by Zeus they meant
more than the sky. The unfathomable depth, the everlasting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="149">149</a></span>
calm of the ethereal sky was to their minds an image of that Infinite
Presence which overshadows all, and looks down on all.
As the question perpetually recurred to their minds, 'Where is
he who abideth forever?' they lifted up their eyes, and saw, as
they thought, beyond sun, and moon, and stars, and all which
changes, and will change, the clear blue sky, the boundless firmament
of heaven. That never changed, that was always the
same. The clouds and storms rolled far below it, and all the
bustle of this noisy world; but there the sky was still, as bright
and calm as ever. The Almighty Father must be there, unchangeable
in the unchangeable heaven; bright, and pure, and
boundless like the heavens, and like the heavens, too, afar off."<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a>

<p>The high and brilliant sky has, in many languages and many
religions, been regarded as the dwelling-place of God. Indeed,
to all of us in Christian times "God is above;" he is "the God
of heaven;" "his throne is in the heavens;" "he reigns on
high." Now, without doing any violence to thought, the name
of the abode might be transferred to him who dwells in heaven.
So that in our own language "heaven" may still be used as a
synonym for "God." The prodigal son is still represented as
saying, I have sinned against "<i>heaven</i>." And a Christian poet
has taught us to sing--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"High <i>heaven</i>, that heard my solemn vow,</p>
<p class="i10">That vow renewed shall daily hear," etc.</p>

<p>Whenever, therefore, we find the name of heaven thus used to
designate also the Deity, we must bear in mind that those by
whom it was originally employed were simply transferring that
name from an object visible to the eye of sense to another object
perceived by the eye of reason. They who at first called God
"<i>Heaven</i>" had some conception within them they wished to
name--the growing image of a God, and they fixed upon the
vastest, grandest, purest object in nature, the deep blue concave
of heaven, overshadowing all, and embracing all, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="150">150</a></span>
symbol of the Deity. Those who at a later period called heaven
"<i>God</i>" had forgotten that they were predicating of heaven something
more which was vastly higher than the heaven.<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a>

<p>Notwithstanding, then, that the instinctive, native faith of
humanity in the existence of one supreme God was overlaid
and almost buried beneath the rank and luxuriant vegetation
of Grecian mythology, we can still catch glimpses here and
there of the solid trunk of native faith, around which this parasitic
growth of fancy is entwined. Above all the phantasmata
of gods and goddesses who descended to the plains of Troy,
and mingled in the din and strife of battle, we can recognize
an overshadowing, all-embracing Power and Providence that
dwells on high, which never descends into the battle-field, and
is never seen by mortal eyes--<i>the Universal King and Father,--the
"God of gods</i>."</p>

<p>Besides the direct evidence, which is furnished by the poets
and mythologists, of the presence of this universal faith in "<i>the
heavenly Father</i>," there is also a large amount of collateral testimony
that this idea of one Supreme God was generally entertained
by the Greek pagans, whether learned or unlearned.<a id="footnotetag182" name="footnotetag172"></a>
<a href="#footnote182"><sup class="sml">182</sup></a>
Dio Chrysostomus says that "all the poets call the first and
greatest God the Father, universally, of all rational kind, as
also the King thereof. Agreeably with which doctrine of the
poets do mankind erect altars to Jupiter-King (Διὸς ßασιλέως)
and hesitate not to call him Father in their devotions" (Orat.
xxxvi.). And Maximus Tyrius declares that both the learned
and the unlearned throughout the pagan world universally
agree in this; that there is one Supreme God, the Father of
gods and men. "If," says he, "there were a meeting called
of all the several trades and professions,... and all were required
to declare their sense concerning God, do you think
that the painter would say one thing, the sculptor another, the
poet another, and the philosopher another? No; nor the
Scythian neither, nor the Greek, nor the hyperborean. In regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="151">151</a></span>
to other things, we find men speaking discordantly one to
another, all men, as it were, differing from all men... Nevertheless,
on this subject, you may find universally throughout
the world one agreeing law and opinion; <i>that there is one God,
the King and Father of all, and many gods, the sons of God, co-reigners
together with God</i>"(Diss. i. p. 450).</p>

former we have regarded as reflecting the traditional beliefs of
the unreasoning multitude. The philosophers unquestionably
represent the reflective spirit, the speculative thought, of the
educated classes of Greek society. Turning to the writings of
the philosophers, we may therefore reasonably expect that, instead
of the dim, undefined, and nebulous form in which the
religious sentiment revealed itself amongst the unreflecting
portions of the Greek populations, we shall find their theological
ideas distinctly and articulately expressed, and that we shall
consequently be able to determine their religious opinions with
considerable accuracy.</p>

<p>Now that Thales, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, Anaxagoras,
Empedocles, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were all believers
in the existence of one supreme, uncreated, eternal God, has
been, we think, clearly shown by Cudworth.<a id="footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a>

<p>In subsequent chapters on "<i>the Philosophers of Athens</i>," we
shall enter more fully into the discussion of this question.
Meantime we assume that, with few exceptions, the Greek philosophers
were "genuine Theists."</p>

<p>The point, however, with which we are now concerned is,
<i>that whilst they believed in one supreme, uncreated, eternal God,
they at the same time recognized the existence of a plurality of generated
deities who owe their existence to the power and will of the
Supreme God, and who, as the agents and ministers of His universal
providence, preside over different departments of the created
universe</i>. They are at once Monotheists and Polytheists--believers
in "one God" and "many gods." This is a peculiarity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="152">152</a></span>
an anomaly which challenges our attention, and demands
an explanation, if we would vindicate for these philosophers a
rational Theism.</p>

<p>Now that there can be but one infinite and absolutely perfect
Being--one supreme, uncreated, eternal God--is self-evident;
therefore a multiplicity of such gods is a contradiction and an
impossibility. The early philosophers knew this as well as the
modern. The Deity, in order to be Deity, must be one and
not many: must be perfect or nothing. If, therefore, we would
do justice to these old Greeks, we must inquire what explanations
they have offered in regard to "the many gods" of which
they speak. We must ascertain whether they regarded these
"gods" as created or uncreated beings, dependent or independent,
temporal or eternal We must inquire in what sense the
term "god" is applied to these lesser divinities,--whether it is
not applied in an accommodated and therefore allowable
sense, as in the sacred Scriptures it is applied to kings and
magistrates, and those who are appointed by God as the teachers
and rulers of men. "<i>They are called gods</i> to whom the word
of God came."<a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a>
<a href="#footnote184"><sup class="sml">184</sup></a> And if it shall be found that all the gods of
which they speak, save <i>one</i>, are "generated deities"--dependent
beings--creatures and subjects of the one eternal King
and Father, and that the name of "god" is applied to them in
an accommodated sense, then we have vindicated for the old
Greek philosophers a consistent and rational Theism. In what
relation, then, do the philosophers place "<i>the gods</i>" to the one
Supreme Being?</p>

<p><i>Thales</i>, one of the most ancient of the Greek philosophers,
taught the existence of a plurality of gods, as is evident from
that saying of his, preserved by Diogenes Laertius, "The world
has life, and is full of gods."<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a>
<a href="#footnote185"><sup class="sml">185</sup></a> At the same time he asserts his
belief in one supreme, uncreated Deity; "God is the oldest of

<a href="#footnote186"><sup class="sml">186</sup></a> All the

<p><i>Xenophanes</i> was also an assertor of many gods, and one God;
but his one God is unquestionably supreme. "There is one
God, the greatest amongst gods and men;" or, "God is one, the
greatest amongst gods and men."<a id="footnotetag188" name="footnotetag188x"></a>
<a href="#footnote188"><sup class="sml">188</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Empedocles</i> also believed in one Supreme God, who "is
wholly and perfectly mind, ineffable, holy, with rapid and swift-glancing
thought pervading the whole world," and from whom
all things else are derived,--"all things that are upon the earth,
and in the air and water, may be truly called the works of God,
who ruleth over the world, out of whom, according to Empedocles,
proceed all things, plants, men, beasts, and <i>gods</i>."<a id="footnotetag189" name="footnotetag189"></a>
<a href="#footnote189"><sup class="sml">189</sup></a>
The minor deities are therefore <i>made</i> by God. It will not be
denied that <i>Socrates</i> was a devout and earnest Theist. He
taught that "there is a Being whose eye pierces throughout all
nature, and whose ear is open to every sound; extending through
all time, extended to all places; and whose bounty and care can
know no other bounds than those fixed by his own creation."<a id="footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a>
<a href="#footnote190"><sup class="sml">190</sup></a>
And yet he also recognized the existence of a plurality of gods,
and in his last moments expressed his belief that "it is lawful
and right to pray to the gods that his departure hence may be
happy."<a id="footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a>
<a href="#footnote191"><sup class="sml">191</sup></a> We see, however, in his words addressed to Euthydemus,
a marked distinction between these subordinate deities
and "Him who raised this whole universe, and still upholds
the mighty frame, who perfected every part of it in beauty and
in goodness, suffering none of these parts to decay through age,

<p>And, now that we have in Plato the culmination of Grecian
speculative thought, we may learn from him the mature and
final judgment of the ancients in regard to the gods of pagan
mythology. We open the <i>Timæus</i>, and here we find his views
most definitely expressed. After giving an account of the
"generation" of the sun, and moon, and planets, which are by
him designated as "visible gods," he then proceeds "to speak
concerning the other divinities:" "We must on this subject assent
to those who in former times have spoken thereon; who
were, as they said, the offspring of the gods, and who doubtless
were well acquainted with their own ancestors..... Let then
the genealogy of the gods be, and be acknowledged to be, that
which they deliver. Of Earth and Heaven the children were
Oceanus and Tethys; and of these the children were Phorcys,
and Kronos, and Rhea, and all that followed these; and from
these were born Zeus and Hera, and those who are regarded as
brothers and sisters of these, and others their offspring.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="155">155</a></span>
"When, then, <i>all the gods were brought into existence</i>, both those
which move around in manifest courses [the stars and planets],
and those which appear when it pleases them [the mythological
deities], the Creator of the Universe thus addressed them:</p>

<p>'Gods, and sons of gods, of whom I am the father and the author,
produced by me, ye are indestructible because I will....
Now inasmuch as you have been <i>generated</i>, you are hence <i>not</i> immortal,
nor wholly indissoluble; yet you shall never be dissolved
nor become subject to the fatality of death, because <i>so I have
willed</i>.... Learn, therefore, my commands. Three races of
mortals yet remain to be created. Unless these be created, the
universe will be imperfect, for it will not contain within it every
kind of animal.... In order that these mortal creatures may
be, and that this world may be really a cosmos, do you apply
yourselves to the creation of animals, imitating the exercises of
my power in <i>creating</i> you.'"<a id="footnotetag195" name="footnotetag195"></a>

<p>Here, then, we see that Plato carefully distinguishes between
the sole Eternal Author of the universe, on one hand, and the
"souls," vital and intelligent, which he attaches to the heavenly
orbs, and diffuses through all nature, on the other. These subordinate
powers or agents are all created, "<i>generated</i> deities,"
who owe their continued existence to the <i>will</i> of God; and
though intrusted with a sort of deputed creation, and a subsequent
direction and government of created things, they are still
only the <i>servants</i> and the <i>deputies</i> of the Supreme Creator, and
Director, and Ruler of all things. These subordinate agents
and ministers employed in the creation and providential government
of the world appear, in the estimation of Plato, to have
been needed--</p>

<p>1. <i>To satisfy the demands of the popular faith</i>, which presented
its facts to be explained no less than those of external nature.
Plato had evidently a great veneration for antiquity, a peculiar
regard for "tradition venerable through ancient report," and
"doctrines hoary with years."<a id="footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a>
<a href="#footnote196"><sup class="sml">196</sup></a> He aspired after supernatural
light and guidance; he longed for some intercourse with, some
communication from, the Deity. And whilst he found many
things in the ancient legends which revolted his moral sense,
and which his reason rejected, yet the sentiment and the lesson
which pervades the whole of Grecian mythology, viz., that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="156">156</a></span>
gods are in ceaseless intercourse with the human race, and if
men will do right the gods will protect and help them, was
one which commended itself to his heart.</p>

<p>2. These intermediate agents seem to have been demanded
to <i>satisfy the disposition and tendency which has revealed itself in
all systems, of interposing some scale of ascent between the material
creation and the infinite Creator</i>.</p>

<p>The mechanical theory of the universe has interposed its
long series of secondary causes--the qualities, properties, laws,
forces of nature; the vital theory which attaches a separate
"soul" to the various parts of nature as the cause and intelligent
director of its movements. Of these "souls" or gods,
there were different orders and degrees--deified men or heroes,
aërial, terrestrial, and celestial divinities, ascending from nature
up to God. And this tendency to supply some scale of
ascent towards the Deity, or at least to people the vast territory
which seems to swell between the world and God, finds some
countenance in "the angels and archangels," "the thrones, and
dominions, and principalities, and powers" of the Christian
scriptures.<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a>
<a href="#footnote197"><sup class="sml">197</sup></a></p>

<p>3. These inferior ministers also seemed to Plato to <i>increase
the stately grandeur and imperial majesty of the Divine government.</i>

<p>Aristotle seems to have regarded the popular polytheism of
Greece as a perverted relic of a deeper and purer "Theology"
which he conceives to have been, in all probability, perfected
in the distant past, and then comparatively lost. He says--
"The tradition has come down from very ancient times, being
left in a mythical garb to succeeding generations, that these
(the heavenly bodies) are gods, and that the Divinity <i>encompasses
the whole of nature</i>. There have been made, however,
to these certain fabulous additions for the purpose of winning
the belief of the multitude, and thus securing their obedience
to the laws, and their co-operation towards advancing the general
welfare of the state. These additions have been to the
effect that these gods were of the same form as men, and even
that some of them were in appearance similar to certain others
amongst the rest of the animal creation. The wise course,
however, would be for the philosopher to disengage from these
traditions the false element, and to embrace that which is true;
and the truth lies in that portion of this ancient doctrine which
regards the first and deepest ground of all existence to be the
<i>Divine</i>, and this he may regard as a divine utterance. In all
probability, every art, and science, and philosophy has been
over and over again discovered to the farthest extent possible,
and then again lost; and we may conceive these opinions to
have been preserved to us as a sort of fragment of these lost
philosophers. We see, then, to some extent the relation of the
popular belief to these ancient opinions."<a id="footnotetag201" name="footnotetag201"></a>

<p>The views of the educated and philosophic mind of Greece
in regard to the mythological deities may, in conclusion, be
thus briefly stated--</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="158">158</a></span>

<p>I. <i>They are all created beings</i>--"GENERATED DEITIES," <i>who are
dependent on, and subject to, the will of one supreme God</i>.</p>

<p>II. <i>They are the</i> AGENTS <i>employed by God in the creation of, at
least some parts of, the universe, and in the movement and direction
of the entire cosmos; and they are also the</i> MINISTERS <i>and</i> MESSENGERS
<i>of that universal providence which he exercises over the
human race</i>.</p>

<p>These subordinate deities are, 1. the greater parts of the
visible mundane system animated by intelligent souls, and called
"<i>sensible gods</i>"--the sun, the moon, the stars, and even the
earth itself, and known by the names Helios, Selena, Kronos,
Hermes, etc.</p>

<p>2. Some are <i>invisible powers</i>, having peculiar offices and
functions and presiding over special places provinces and departments
of the universe;--one ruling in the heavens (Zeus),
another in the air (Juno), another in the sea (Neptune), another
in the subterranean regions (Pluto); one god presiding over
learning and wisdom (Minerva), another over poetry, music,
and religion (Apollo), another over justice and political order
(Themis), another over war (Mars), another over corn (Ceres),
and another the vine (Bacchus).</p>

<p>3. Others, again, are <i>ethereal</i> and <i>aërial</i> beings, who have
the guardianship of individual persons and things, and are called
<i>demons, genii</i>, and <i>lares</i>; superior indeed to men, but inferior
to the gods above named.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, since there were no other gods among the
Pagans besides those above enumerated, unless their images,
statues, and symbols should be accounted such (because they
were also sometimes abusively called 'gods'), which could
not be supposed by them to have been unmade or without beginning,
they being the workmanship of their own hands, we
conclude, universally, that all that multiplicity of Pagan gods
which make so great a show and noise was really either nothing
but several names and notions of one supreme Deity, according
to his different manifestations, gifts, and effects upon
the world personated, or else many inferior understanding beings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="159">159</a></span>
generated or created by one supreme: so that one unmade,
self-existent Deity, and no more, was acknowledged by
the more intelligent Pagans, and, consequently, the Pagan Polytheism
(or idolatry) consisted not in worshipping a multiplicity
of unmade minds, deities, and creators, self-existent from
eternity, and independent upon one Supreme, but in mingling
and blending some way or other, unduly, creature-worship with
the worship of the Creator."<a id="footnotetag203" name="footnotetag203"></a>

<p>That the heathen regard the one Supreme Being as the first
and chief object of worship is evident from the apologies which
they offered for worshipping, besides Him, many inferior divinities.</p>

<p>1. They claimed to worship them <i>only</i> as inferior beings,
and that therefore they were not guilty of giving them that
honor which belonged to the Supreme. They claimed to worship
the supreme God incomparably above all. 2. That this
honor which is bestowed upon the inferior divinities does ultimately
redound to the supreme God, and aggrandize his state
and majesty, they being all his ministers and attendants. 3.
That as demons are mediators between the celestial gods and
men, so those celestial gods are also mediators between men
and the supreme God, and, as it were, convenient steps by
which we ought with reverence to approach him. 4. That
demons or angels being appointed to preside over kingdoms,
cities, and persons, and being many ways benefactors to us,
thanks ought to be returned to them by sacrifice. 5. Lastly,
that it can not be thought that the Supreme Being will envy
those inferior beings that worship or honor which is bestowed
upon them; nor suspect that any of these inferior deities will
factiously go about to set up themselves against the Supreme
God.</p>

<p>The Pagans, furthermore, apologized for worshipping God
in images, statues, and symbols, on the ground that these were
only schetically worshipped by them, the honor passing from
them to the prototype. And since we live in bodies, and can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="160" >160</a></span>
scarcely, conceive of any thing without having some image or
phantasm, we may therefore be indulged in this infirmity of
human nature (at least in the vulgar) to worship God under a
corporeal image, as a means of preventing men from falling into
Atheism.</p>

<p>To the Christian conscience the above reasons assigned
furnish no real justification of Polytheism and Idolatry; but
they are certainly a tacit confession of their belief in the one
Supreme God, and their conviction that, notwithstanding their
idolatry, He only ought to be worshipped. The heathen polytheists
are therefore justly condemned in Scripture, and pronounced
to be "<i>inexcusable</i>." They had the knowledge of the
true God--" they <i>knew God</i>" and yet "they glorified him not
as God." "They changed the glory of the incorruptible God
into a likeness of corruptible man." And, finally, they ended
in "worshipping and serving the creature <i>more</i> than the Creator."<a id="footnotetag204" name="footnotetag204"></a>

<p>It can not, then, with justice be denied that the Athenians
had some knowledge of the true God, and some just and worthy
conceptions of his character. It is equally certain that a
powerful and influential religious sentiment pervaded the Athenian
mind. Their extreme "carefulness in religion" must be
conceded by us, and, in some sense, commended by us, as it
was by Paul in his address on Mars' Hill. At the same time
it must also be admitted and deplored that the purer theology

creed. And there is this strange incongruity and inconsistency
in the conduct of the Homeric gods,--they punish mortals for
crimes of which they themselves are guilty, and reward virtues
in men which they do not themselves always practise. "They
punish with especial severity social and political crimes, such
as perjury (Iliad, iii. 279), oppression of the poor (Od. xvii.
475), and unjust judgment in courts of justice (Iliad, xvi. 386)."
Jupiter is the god of justice, and of the domestic hearth; he is
the protector of the exile, the avenger of the poor, and the vigilant
guardian of hospitality. "And with all the imperfections
of society, government, and religion, the poem presents a remarkable
picture of primitive simplicity, chastity, justice, and
practical piety, under the three-fold influence of moral feeling,
mutual respect, and fear of the divine displeasure; such, at
least, are the motives to which Telemachus makes his appeal
when he endeavors to rouse the assembled people of Ithaca to
the performance of their duty (Od. ii. 64)."<a id="footnotetag206" name="footnotetag206"></a>

<p>The influence of the religious dramas of Æschylus and
Sophocles on the Athenian mind must not be overlooked.
No writer of pagan antiquity made the voice of conscience
speak with the same power and authority that Æschylus did.
"Crime," he says, "never dies without posterity." "Blood
that has been shed congeals on the ground, crying out for an
avenger." The old poet made himself the echo of what he
called "the lyreless hymn of the Furies," who, with him, represented
severe Justice striking the guilty when his hour comes,
and giving warning beforehand by the terrors which haunt him.
His dramas are characterized by deep religious feeling. Reverence
for the gods, the recognition of an inflexible moral
order, resignation to the decisions of Heaven, an abiding presentiment
of a future state of reward and punishment, are strikingly
predominant.</p>

<p>Whilst Æschylus reveals to us the sombre, terror-stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="162">162</a></span>
side of conscience, Sophocles shows us the divine and luminous
side. No one has ever spoken with nobler eloquence than
he of moral obligation--of this immortal, inflexible law, in
which dwells a God that never grows old--</p>

<p>Such a theology could not have been utterly powerless. The
influence of truth, in every measure and degree, must be salutary,
and especially of truth in relation to God, to duty, and to
immortality. The religion of the Athenians must have had
some wholesome and conserving influence of the social and

this lower world almost exclusively to Satan, may see, in the religion
of the Greeks, a simple creation of Satanic powers. But
he who believes that the entire progress of humanity has been
under the control and direction of a benignant Providence,
must suppose that, in the purposes of God, even Ethnicism has
fulfilled some end, or it would not have been permitted to live.
God has "<i>never left himself without a witness</i>" in any nation
under heaven. And some preparatory office has been fulfilled
by Heathenism which, at least, repealed the <i>want</i>, and prepared
the mind for, the advent of Christianity.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote209"

(return) </a> The practice, so common with some theological writers, of drawing dark
pictures of heathenism, in which not one luminous spot is visible, in order
to exalt the revelations given to the Jews, is exceedingly unfortunate, and
highly reprehensible. It is unfortunate, because the skeptical scholar knows
that there were some elements of truth and excellence, and even of grandeur,
in the religion and civilization of the republics of Greece and Rome; and
it is reprehensible, because it is a one-sided and unjust procedure, in so far
as it withholds part of the truth. This species of argument is a two-edged
sword which cuts both ways. The prevalence of murder, and slavery, and
treachery, and polygamy, in Greece and Rome, is no more a proof that "the
religions of the pagan nations were destructive of morality" (Watson, vol.
i. p. 59), than the polygamy of the Hebrews, the falsehoods and impositions
of Mediaeval Christianity, the persecutions and martyrdoms of Catholic
Christianity, the oppressions and wrongs of Christian England, and the slavery
of Protestant America, are proofs that the Christian religion is "destructive
of morality." What a fearful picture of the history of Christian
nations might be drawn to-day, if all the lines of light, and goodness, and
charity were left out, and the crimes, and wrongs, and cruelties of the Christian
nations were alone exhibited!

<p>How much more convincing a proof of the truth of Christianity to find in
the religions of the ancient world a latent sympathy with, and an unconscious
preparation for, the religion of Christ. "The history of religions of
human origin is the most striking evidence of the agreement of revealed religion
with the soul of man--for each of these forms of worship is the expression
of the wants of conscience, its eternal thirst for pardon and restoration--rather
let us say, its thirst for God."--Pressensé, p. 6.</blockquote>

<p>The religion of the Athenians was unable to deliver them
from the guilt of sin, redeem them from its power, and make
them pure and holy. It gave the Athenian no victory over
himself, and, practically, brought him no nearer to the living
God. But it awakened and educated the conscience, it developed
more fully the sense of sin and guilt, and it made man
conscious of his inability to save himself from sin and guilt;
and "the day that humanity awakens to the want of something
more than mere embellishment and culture, that day it feels the
need of being saved and restored from the consequences of
sin" by a higher power. Æsthetic taste had found its fullest
gratification in Athens; poetry, sculpture, architecture, had
been carried to the highest perfection; a noble civilization had
been reached; but "the need of something deeper and truer
was written on the very stones." The highest consummation of
Paganism was an altar to "the unknown God," the knowledge
of whom it needed, as the source of purity and peace.</p>

<p>The strength and the weakness of Grecian mythology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="164">164</a></span>
consisted in the contradictory character of its divinities. It was
a strange blending of the natural and the supernatural, the human
and the divine. Zeus, the eternal Father,--the immortal
King, whose will is sovereign, and whose power is invincible,--the
All-seeing Jove, has some of the weaknesses and passions
of humanity. God and man are thus, in some mysterious way,
united. And here that deepest longing of the human heart is
met--the unconquerable desire to bring God nearer to the human
apprehension, and closer to the human heart. Hence the
hold which Polytheism had upon the Grecian mind. But in this
human aspect was also found its weakness, for when philosophic
thought is brought into contact with, and permitted critically
to test mythology, it dethrones the false gods. The age
of spontaneous religious sentiment must necessarily be succeeded
by the age of reflective thought. Popular theological
faiths must be placed in the hot crucible of dialectic analysis,
that the false and the frivolous may be separated from the pure
and the true. The reason of man demands to be satisfied, as
well as the heart. Faith in God must have a logical basis, it
must be grounded on demonstration and proof. Or, at any
rate, the question must be answered, <i>whether God is cognizable
by human reason</i>? If this can be achieved, then a deeper
foundation is laid in the mind of humanity, upon which Christianity
can rear its higher and nobler truths.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h3>THE UNKNOWN GOD.</h3>

<p>"As I passed by, and beheld your sacred objects, I found an altar with
this inscription, <i>To the Unknown God</i>."--ST. PAUL.</p>

<p>"That which can be <i>known</i> of God is manifested in their hearts, God
himself having shown it to them" [the heathen nations].--ST. PAUL.</p>

<p>Having now reached our first landing-place, from whence
we may survey the fields that we have traversed, it may
be well to set down in definite propositions the results we have
attained. We may then carry them forward, as torches, to illuminate
the path of future and still profounder inquiries.</p>

<p>The principles we have assumed as the only adequate and
legitimate interpretation of the facts of religious history, and
which an extended study of the most fully-developed religious
system of the ancient world confirms, may be thus announced:</p>

<p>I. A religious nature and destination appertain to man, so
that the purposes of his existence and the perfection of his
being can only be secured in and through religion.</p>

<p>II. The idea of God as the unconditioned Cause, the infinite
Mind, the personal Lord and Lawgiver, and the consciousness
of dependence upon and obligation to God, are the fundamental
principles of all religion.</p>

<p>III. Inasmuch as man is a religious being, the instincts and
emotions of his nature constraining him to worship, there must
also be implanted in his rational nature some original <i>à priori</i>
ideas or laws of thought which furnish the necessary cognition
of the object of worship; that is, some native, spontaneous
cognition of God.</p>

<p>A mere blind impulse would not be adequate to guide man
to the true end and perfection of his being without rational
ideas; a tendency or appetency, without a revealed object,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="166" >166</a></span>
would be the mockery and misery of his nature--an "ignis
fatuus" perpetually alluring and forever deceiving man.</p>

<p>That man has a native, spontaneous apperception of a God,
in the true import of that sacred name, has been denied by
men of totally opposite schools and tendencies of thought--by
the Idealist and the Materialist; by the Theologian and the
Atheist. Though differing essentially in their general principles
and method, they are agreed in asserting that God is absolutely
"<i>the unknown</i>;" and that, so far as reason and logic
are concerned, man can not attain to any knowledge of the first
principles and causes of the universe, and, consequently, can
not determine whether the first principle or principles be intelligent
or unintelligent, personal or impersonal, finite or infinite,
one or many righteous or non-righteous, evil or good.</p>

<p>The various opponents of the doctrine that God can be
cognized by human reason may be classified as follows:
I. <i>Those who assert that all human knowledge is necessarily
confined to the observation and classification of phenomena in their
orders of co-existence, succession, and resemblance</i>. Man has no
faculty for cognizing substances, causes, forces, reasons, first
principles--no power by which he can <i>know</i> God. This class
may be again subdivided into--</p>

<p>1. Those who limit all knowledge to the observation and
classification of <i>mental</i> phenomena (<i>e. g</i>., Idealists like J. S.
Mill).</p>

<p>2. Those who limit all knowledge to the observation and
classification of <i>material</i> phenomena (<i>e. g</i>., Materialists like
Comte).</p>

<p>II. <i>The second class comprises all who admit that philosophic
knowledge is the knowledge of effects as dependent on causes, and of
qualities as inherent in substances; but at the same time assert that
"all knowledge is of the phenomenal</i>." Philosophy can never
attain to a positive knowledge of the First Cause. Of existence,
absolutely and in itself, we know nothing. The infinite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="167">167</a></span>
can not by us be comprehended, conceived, or thought. <i>Faith</i>
is the organ by which we apprehend what is beyond knowledge.
We believe in the existence of God, but we can not <i>know</i> God.
This class, also, may be again subdivided into--</p>

<p>1. Those who affirm that our idea of the Infinite First
Cause is grounded on an <i>intuitional</i> or subjective faith, necessitated
by an "impotence of thought"--that is, by a
mental inability to conceive an absolute limitation or an
infinite illimitation, an absolute commencement or an infinite
non-commencement. Both contradictory opposites are
equally incomprehensible and inconceivable to us; and yet,
though unable to view either as possible, we are forced by a
higher law--the "Law of Excluded Middle"--to admit that
one, and only one, is necessary (<i>e. g</i>., Hamilton and Mansel).</p>

<p>2. Those who assert that our idea of God rests solely on
an <i>historical</i> or objective faith in testimony--the testimony
of Scripture, which assures us that, in the course of history,
God has manifested his existence in an objective manner to
the senses, and given verbal communications of his character
and will to men; human reason being utterly incapacitated
by the fall, and the consequent depravity of man, to attain
any knowledge of the unity, spirituality, and righteousness
of God (<i>e. g</i>., Watson, and Dogmatic Theologians generally).</p>

<p>It will thus be manifest that the great question, the central
and vital question which demands a thorough and searching
consideration, is the following, to wit: <i>Is God cognizable by human
reason</i>? Can man attain to a positive cognition of God--can
he <i>know</i> God; or is all our supposed knowledge "a learned
ignorance,"<a id="footnotetag210" name="footnotetag210"></a>
<a href="#footnote210"><sup class="sml">210</sup></a> an unreasoning faith? We venture to answer this
question in the affirmative. Human reason is now adequate
to the cognition of God; it is able, with the fullest confidence,
to affirm the being of a God, and, in some degree, to determine
his character. The parties and schools above referred to answer
this question in the negative form. Whether Theologians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="168">168</a></span>
or Atheists, they are singularly agreed in denying to human
reason all possibility of <i>knowing</i> God.</p>

name="footnote210"><b>Footnote 210: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag210">
(return) </a> Hamilton's "Philosophy," p. 512.</blockquote>

<p>Before entering upon the discussion of the negative positions
enumerated in the above classification, it may be important we
should state our own position explicitly, and exhibit what we
regard as the true doctrine of the genesis of the idea of God in
the human intelligence. The real question at issue will then
stand out in clear relief, and precision will be given to the entire
discussion.</p>

<p>(i.) <i>We hold that the idea of God is a common phenomenon of
the universal human intelligence</i>. It is found in all minds where
reason has had its normal and healthy development; and no
race of men has ever been found utterly destitute of the idea
of God. The proof of this position has already been furnished
in chap, ii.,<a id="footnotetag211" name="footnotetag211"></a>
<a href="#footnote211"><sup class="sml">211</sup></a> and needs not be re-stated here. We have simply
to remark that the appeal which is made by Locke and others
of the sensational school to the experiences of infants, idiots,
the deaf and dumb, or, indeed, any cases wherein the proper
conditions for the normal development of reason are wanting,
are utterly irrelevant to the question. The acorn contains
within itself the rudimental germ of the future oak, but its mature
and perfect development depends on the exterior conditions
of moisture, light, and heat. By these exterior conditions
it may be rendered luxuriant in its growth, or it may be stunted
in its growth. It may barely exist under one class of conditions;
it may be distorted and perverted, or it may perish utterly
under another. And so in the idiotic mind the ideas of
reason may be wanting, or they may be imprisoned by impervious
walls of cerebral malformation. In the infant mind the development
of reason is yet in an incipient stage. The idea of
God is immanent to the infant thought, but the infant thought
is not yet matured. The deaf and dumb are certainly not in
that full and normal correlation to the world of sense which is a
necessary condition of the development of reason. Language,
the great vehiculum and instrument of thought, is wanting, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="169">169</a></span>
reason can not develop itself without words. "Words without thought
are dead sounds, <i>thoughts without words are nothing</i>.
The word is the thought incarnate."<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a>
<a href="#footnote212"><sup class="sml">212</sup></a> Under proper and
normal conditions, the idea of God is the natural and necessary
form in which human thought must be developed. And, with
these explanations, we repeat our affirmation that the idea of
God is a common phenomenon of the universal human intelligence.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>We do not hold that the idea of God, in its completeness, is a
simple, direct, and immediate intuition of the reason alone, independent
of all experience, and all knowledge of the external world</i>. The
idea of God is a complex idea, and not a simple idea. The affirmation,
"God exists," is a <i>synthetic</i> and <i>primitive</i> judgment
spontaneously developed in the mind, and developed, too, independent
of all reflective reasoning. It is a necessary deduction
from the facts of the outer world of nature and the primary intuitions
of the inner world of reason--a logical deduction from
the self-evident truths given in sense, consciousness, and reason.
"We do not <i>perceive</i> God, but we <i>conceive</i> Him upon the faith
of this admirable world exposed to view, and upon the other
world, more admirable still, which we bear in ourselves."<a id="footnotetag213" name="footnotetag213"></a>
<a href="#footnote213"><sup class="sml">213</sup></a>
Therefore we do not say that man is born with an "innate
idea" of God, nor with the definite proposition, "there is a
God," written upon his soul; but we do say that the mind is
pregnant with certain natural principles, and governed, in its
development, by certain necessary laws of thought, which determine
it, by a <i>spontaneous logic</i>, to affirm the being of a God;
and, furthermore, that this judgment may be called <i>innate</i> in
the sense, that it is the primitive, universal, and necessary development
of the human understanding which "is innate to itself
and equal to itself in all men."<a id="footnotetag214" name="footnotetag214"></a>

<p>As the vital and rudimentary germ of the oak is contained
in the acorn; as it is quickened and excited to activity by the
external conditions of moisture, light, and heat, and is fully de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="170">170</a></span>
developed under the fixed and determinative laws of vegetable
life--so the germs of the idea of God are present in the human
mind as the intuitions of pure reason (<i>Rational Psychology</i>);
these intuitions are excited to energy by our experiential and
historical knowledge of the facts and laws of the universe (<i>Phenomenology</i>);
and these facts and intuitions are developed into
form by the necessary laws of the intellect (<i>Nomology</i>, or <i>Primordial
Logic</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>logical demonstration</i> of the being of God commences
with the analysis of thought. It asks, What are the ideas which
exist in the human intelligence? What are their actual characteristics,
and what their primitive characteristics? What is
their origin, and what their validity? Having, by this process,
found that some of our ideas are subjective, and some objective
that some are derived from experience, and that some can
not be derived from experience, but are inherent in the very constitution
of the mind itself, as <i>à priori</i> ideas of reason; that
these are characterized as self-evident, universal, and necessary
and that, as laws of thought, they govern the mind in all
its conceptions of the universe; it has formulated these necessary
judgments, and presented them as distinct and articulate
propositions. These <i>à priori</i>, necessary judgments constitute
the major premise of the Theistic syllogism, and, in view of the
facts of the universe, necessitate the affirmation of the existence
of a God as the only valid explanation of the facts.</p>

<p>The <i>natural</i> or <i>chronological order</i> in which the idea of God
is developed in the human intelligence, is the reverse process
of the scientific or logical order, in which the demonstration
of the being of God is presented by philosophy; the latter is
<i>reflective</i> and <i>analytic</i>, the former is <i>spontaneous</i> and <i>synthetic.</i>
The natural order commences with the knowledge of the facts
of the universe, material and mental, as revealed by sensation
and experience. In presence of these facts of the universe,
the <i>à priori</i> ideas of power, cause, reason, and end are evoked
into consciousness with greater or less distinctness; and the
judgment, by a natural and spontaneous logic, free from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="171" >171</a></span>
reflection, and consequently from all possibility of error, affirms
a necessary relation between the facts of experience and the
<i>à priori</i> ideas of the reason. The result of this involuntary
and almost unconscious process of thought is that natural cognition
of a God found, with greater or less clearness and definiteness,
in all rational minds. The <i>à posteriori</i>, or empirical
knowledge of the phenomena of the universe, in their relations
to time and space, constitute the minor premise of the Theistic
syllogism.</p>

<p>The Theistic argument is, therefore, necessarily composed
of both experiential and <i>à priori</i> elements. An <i>à posteriori</i>
element exists as a condition of the logical demonstration
The rational <i>à priori</i> element is, however, the logical basis, the
only valid foundation of the Theistic demonstration. The facts
of the universe alone would never lead man to the recognition
of a God, if the reason, in presence of these facts, did not
enounce certain necessary and universal principles which are
the logical antecedents, and adequate explanation of the facts.
Of what use would it be to point to the events and changes of
the material universe as proofs of the existence of a <i>First Cause,</i>
unless we take account of the universal and necessary truth
that "every change must have an efficient cause;" that all
phenomena are an indication of <i>power</i>; and that "there is an
ultimate and sufficient reason why all things exist, and are as
they are, and not otherwise." There would be no logical force
in enumerating the facts of order and special adaptation which
literally crowd the universe, as proofs of the existence of an
<i>Intelligent Creator</i>, if the mind did not affirm the necessary principle
that "facts of order, having a commencement in time,
suppose mind as their source and exponent." There is no
logical conclusiveness in the assertion of Paley, "that <i>experience</i>
teaches us that a designer must be a person," because, as
Hume justly remarks, our "experience" is narrowed down to
a mere point, "and can not be a rule for a universe;" but
there is an infinitude of force in that dictum of reason, that
"intelligence, self-consciousness, and self-determination necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="172">172</a></span>
constitute personality." A multiplicity of different effects,
of which experience does not always reveal the connection,
would not conduct to a single cause and to <i>one</i> God, but rather
to a plurality of causes and a plurality of gods, did not reason
teach us that "all plurality implies an ultimate indivisible
unity," and therefore there must be a <i>First Cause</i> of all causes,
a <i>First Principle</i> of all principles, <i>the Substance</i> of all substances,
<i>the Being</i> of all beings--<i>a God</i> "of whom, in whom, and to
whom are all things" (πάντα ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ, ἐν τῷ θεῷ, εἰς τὸν θεόν).</p>

<p>The conclusion, therefore, is, that, as the idea of God is a
complex idea, so there are necessarily a number of simple <i>à
priori</i> principles, and a variety of experiential facts conspiring
to its development in the human intelligence.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>The universe presents to the human mind an aggregation
and history of phenomena which demands the idea of a God--a
self-existent, intelligent, personal, righteous First Cause--as its adequate
explanation.</i></p>

<p>The attempt of Positivism to confine all human knowledge
to the observation and classification of phenomena, and arrest
and foreclose all inquiry as to causes, efficient, final, and ultimate,
is simply futile and absurd. It were just as easy to arrest
the course of the sun in mid-heaven as to prevent the human
mind from seeking to pass beyond phenomena, and ascertain
the ground, and reason, and cause of all phenomena. The history
of speculative thought clearly attests that, in all ages, the
inquiry after the Ultimate Cause and Reason of all existence--the
ἀρχή, or First Principle of all things--has been the inevitable
and necessary tendency of the human mind; to resist which,
skepticism and positivism have been utterly impotent. The
first philosophers, of the Ionian school, had just as strong a
faith in the existence of a Supreme Reality--an Ultimate Cause--as
Leibnitz and Cousin. But when, by reflective thought,
they attempted to render an account to themselves of this instinctive
faith, they imagined that its object must be in some
way appreciable to sense, and they sought it in some physical
element, or under some visible and tangible shrine. Still, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="173">173</a></span>
imperfect and inadequate the method, and however unsatisfactory
the results, humanity has never lost its positive and
ineradicable confidence that the problem of existence could be
solved. The resistless tide of spontaneous and necessary
thought has always borne the race onward towards the recognition
of a great First Cause; and though philosophy may have
erred, again and again, in tracing the logical order of this inevitable
thought, and exhibiting the necessary nexus between the
premises and conclusion, yet the human mind has never wavered
in the confidence which it has reposed in the natural
logic of thought, and man has never ceased to believe in a God.</p>

<p>We readily grant that all our empirical knowledge is confined
to phenomena in their orders of co-existence, succession,
and resemblance. "To our objective perception and comparison
nothing is given but qualities and changes; to our inductive
generalization nothing but the shifting and grouping of
these in time and space." Were it, however, our immediate
concern to discuss the question, we could easily show that sensationalism
has never succeeded in tracing the genetic origin
of our ideas of space and time to observation and experience;
and, without the <i>à priori</i> idea of <i>space</i>, as the place of bodies,
and of <i>time</i>, as the condition of succession, we can not conceive
of phenomena at all. If, therefore, we know any thing beyond
phenomena and their mutual relations; if we have any cognition
of realities underlying phenomena, and of the relations
of phenomena to their objective ground, it must be given by
some faculty distinct from sense-perception, and in some process
distinct from inductive generalization. The knowledge of
real Being and real Power, of an ultimate Reason and a personal
Will, is derived from the apperception of pure reason,
which affirms the necessary existence of a Supreme Reality--an
Uncreated Being beyond all phenomena, which is the ground
and reason of the existence--the contemporaneousness and
succession--the likeness and unlikeness, of all phenomena.</p>

<p>The immediate presentation of phenomena to sensation is
the <i>occasion</i> of the development in consciousness of these <i>à</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="174">174</a></span>
<i>priori</i> ideas of reason: the possession of these ideas or the immanence
of these ideas, in the human intellect, constitutes the
original <i>power</i> to know external phenomena. The ideas of
space, time, power, law, reason, and end, are the logical antecedents
of the ideas of body, succession, event, consecution, order,
and adaptation. The latter can not be conceived as distinct
notions without the former. The former will not be revealed
in thought without the presentation to sense, of resistance,
movement, change, uniformity, etc. All actual knowledge must,
therefore, be impure; that is, it must involve both <i>à priori</i> and
<i>à posteriori</i> elements; and between these elements there must
be a necessary relation.</p>

<p>This necessary relation between the <i>à priori</i> and <i>à posteriori</i>
elements of knowledge is not a mere subjective law of thought.
It is both a law of thought and a law of things. Between the
<i>à posteriori</i> facts of the universe and the <i>à priori</i> ideas of the
reason there is an absolute nexus, a universal and necessary
correlation; so that the cognition of the latter is possible only
on the cognition of the former; and the objective existence of
the realities, represented by the ideas of reason, is the condition,
<i>sine qua non</i>, of the existence of the phenomena presented
to sense. If, in one indivisible act of consciousness, we immediately
perceive extended matter exterior to our percipient
mind, then Extension exists objectively; and if Extension exists
objectively, then Space, its <i>conditio sine qua non</i>, also exists objectively.
And if a definite body reveals to us the <i>Space</i> in
which it is contained, if a succession of pulsations or movements
exhibit the uniform <i>Time</i> beneath, so do the changeful
phenomena of the universe demand a living <i>Power</i> behind,
and the existing order and regular evolution of the universe
presuppose <i>Thought</i>--prevision, and predetermination, by an
intelligent mind.</p>

<p>If, then, the universe is a created effect, it must furnish some
indications of the character of its cause. If, as Plato taught,
the world is a "created image" of the eternal archetypes which
dwell in the uncreated Mind, and if the subjective ideas which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="175">175</a></span>
dwell in the human reason, as the offspring of God, are "copies"
of the ideas of the Infinite Reason--if the universe be
"the autobiography of the Infinite Spirit which has also repeated
itself in miniature within our finite spirit," then may we decipher
its symbols, and read its lessons straight off. Then every
approach towards a scientific comprehension and generalization
of the facts of the universe must carry us upward towards
the higher realities of reason. The more we can understand
of Nature--of her comprehensive laws, of her archetypal forms,
of her far-reaching plan spread through the almost infinite ages,
and stretching through illimitable space--the more do we comprehend
the divine Thought. The inductive generalization of
science gradually <i>ascends</i> towards the universal; the pure, essential,
<i>à priori</i> reason, with its universal and necessary ideas, <i>descends</i>
from above to meet it. The general conceptions of science
are thus a kind of <i>ideœ umbratiles</i>--shadowy assimilations
to those immutable ideas which dwell in essential reason, as
possessed by the Supreme Intelligence, and which are participated
in by rational man as the offspring and image of God.</p>

<p>Without making any pretension to profound scientific accuracy,
we offer the following tentative classification of the facts
of the universe, material and mental, which may be regarded
as hints and adumbrations of the ultimate ground, and reason,
and cause, of the universe. We shall venture to classify these
facts as indicative of some fundamental relation; (i.) to Permanent
Being or Reality; (ii.) to Reason and Thought; (iii.) to
Moral Ideas and Ends.</p>

<p>(i.) <i>Facts of the universe which indicate some fundamental relation
to Permanent Being or Reality</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Qualitative</i> Phenomena (properties, attributes, qualities)--the
predicates of a <i>subject</i>; which phenomena, being characterized
by likeness and unlikeness, are capable of comparison
and classification, and thus of revealing something as to
the nature of the <i>subject</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Dynamical</i> Phenomena (protension, movement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="176">176</a></span>
succession)--events
transpiring in <i>time</i>, having beginning, succession,
and end, which present themselves to us as the expression
of <i>power</i>, and throw back their distinctive characteristics
on their <i>dynamic</i> source.</p>

<p>3. <i>Quantitative</i> Phenomena (totality, multiplicity, relative
unity)--a multiplicity of objects having relative and composite
unity, which suggests some relation to an absolute and
indivisible <i>unity</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Statical</i> Phenomena (extension, magnitude, divisibility)--bodies
co-existing in <i>space</i> which are limited, conditioned,
relative, dependent, and indicate some relation to that which
is self-existent, unconditioned, and absolute.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Facts of the universe which indicate some fundamental relation
to Reason or Thought</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Numerical and Geometrical Proportion</i>.--Definite proportion
of elements (Chemistry), symmetrical arrangement of
parts (Crystallography), numerical and geometrical relation of
the forms and movements of the heavenly bodies (Spherical
Astronomy), all of which are capable of exact mathematical
expression.</p>

<p>2. <i>Archetypal Forms</i>.--The uniform succession of new existences,
and the progressive evolution of new orders and
species, conformable to fixed and definite ideal archetypes,
the indication of a comprehensive <i>plan</i>(Morphological Botany,
Comparative Anatomy).</p>

<p>3. <i>Teleology of Organs</i>.--The adaptation of organs to the
fulfillment of special functions, indicating <i>design</i>(Comparative
Physiology).</p>

<p>4. <i>Combination of Homotypes and Analogues</i>.--Diversified
homologous forms made to fulfill analogous functions, or
special purposes fulfilled whilst maintaining a general plan,
indicating <i>choice</i> and <i>alternativity</i>.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Facts of the universe which indicate some fundamental
relation to Moral Ideas and Ends</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="177">177</a></span></p>

<p>1. <i>Ethical Distinctions</i>.--The universal tendency to discriminate
between voluntary acts as right or wrong, indicating
some relation to an <i>immutable moral standard of right</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sense of Obligation</i>.--The universal consciousness of
dependence and obligation, indicating some relation to
Supreme <i>Power</i>, an Absolute <i>Authority</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Feeling of Responsibility</i>.--The universal consciousness
of liability to be required to give account for, and endure the
consequences of our action, indicating some relation to a
Supreme <i>Judge</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Retributive Issues</i>.--The pleasure and pain resulting
from moral action in this life, and the universal anticipation
of pleasure or pain in the future, as the consequence of present
conduct, indicate an <i>absolute Justice</i> ruling the world
and man.</p>

<p>Now, if the universe be a <i>created effect</i>, it must, in some degree
at least, reveal the character of its Author and cause. We
are entitled to regard it as a created symbol and image of the
Deity; it must bear the impress of his <i>power</i>; it must reveal
his infinite <i>presence</i>; it must express his <i>thoughts</i>; it must embody
and realize his <i>ideals</i>, so far, at least, as material symbols
will permit. Just as we see the power and thought of man revealed
in his works, his energy and skill, his ideal and his taste
expressed in his mechanical, artistic, and literary creations, so
we may see the mind and character of God displayed in his
works. The skill and contrivance of Watts, and Fulton, and
Stephenson were exhibited in their mechanical productions.
The pure, the intense, the visionary impersonation of the soul
which the artist had conjured in his own imagination was wrought
out in Psyché. The colossal grandeur of Michael Angelo's
ideals, the ethereal and saintly elegance of Raphael's were realized
upon the canvas. So he who is familiar with the ideal of
the sculptor or the painter can identify his creations even when
the author's name is not affixed. And so the "eternal Power"
of God is "clearly seen" in the mighty orbs which float in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="178">178</a></span>
illimitable space. The vastness of the universe shadows forth
the infinity of God. The indivisible unity of space and the
ideal unity of the universe reflect the unity of God. The material
forms around us are symbols of divine ideas, and the successive
history of the universe is an expression of the divine
thought; whilst the ethical ideas and sentiments inherent in the
human mind are a reflection of the moral character of God.</p>

<p>The reader can not have failed to observe the form in which
the Theistic argument is stated; "<i>if</i> the finite universe is a
created effect, it must reveal something as to the nature of its
cause: <i>if</i> the existing order and arrangement of the universe
had a commencement in time, it must have an ultimate and
adequate cause." The question, therefore, presents itself in a
definite form: "<i>Is the universe finite or infinite; had the order
of the universe a beginning, or is it eternal</i>?"</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that this is the central and vital
question in the Theistic argument. If the order and arrangement
of the universe is <i>eternal</i>, then that order is an inherent
law of nature, and, as eternal, does not imply a cause <i>ab extra:</i>
if it is not eternal, then the ultimate cause of that order must
be a power above and beyond nature. In the former case the
minor premise of the Theistic syllogism is utterly invalidated;
in the latter case it is abundantly sustained.</p>

<p>Some Theistic writers--as Descartes, Pascal, Leibnitz, and
Saisset--have made the fatal admission that the universe is, in
some sense, <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i>. In making this admission they
have unwittingly surrendered the citadel of strength, and deprived
the argument by which they would prove the being of a
God of all its logical force. That argument is thus presented by
Saisset: "The finite supposes the infinite. Extension supposes
first space, then immensity: duration supposes first time, then
eternity. A sudden and irresistible judgment refers this to the
necessary, infinite, perfect being."<a id="footnotetag215" name="footnotetag215"></a>
<a href="#footnote215"><sup class="sml">215</sup></a> But if "the world is infinite
and eternal,"<a id="footnotetag216" name="footnotetag216"></a>
<a href="#footnote216"><sup class="sml">216</sup></a> may not nature, or the totality of all existence
(τὺ πᾶν), be the necessary, infinite, and perfect Being? An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="179">179</a></span>
infinite and eternal universe has the reason of its existence in
itself, and the existence of such a universe can never prove to
us the existence of an infinite and eternal God.</p>

<p>A closer examination of the statements and reasonings of Descartes,
Pascal, and Leibnitz, as furnished by Saisset, will show
that these distinguished mathematicans were misled by the false
notion of "<i>mathematical</i> infinitude." Their infinite universe,
after all, is not an "absolute," but a "relative" infinite; that is,
the indefinite. "The universe must extend <i>indefinitely</i> in time
and space, in the infinite greatness, and in the infinite littleness
of its parts--in the infinite variety of its species, of its forms,
and of its degrees of existence. The finite can not express the
infinite but by being <i>multiplied</i> infinitely. The finite, so far as
it is finite, is not in any reasonable relation, or in any intelligible
proportion to the infinite. But the finite, as <i>multiplied</i> infinitely,<a id="footnotetag217" name="footnotetag217"></a>
<a href="#footnote217"><sup class="sml">217</sup></a>
ages upon ages, spaces upon spaces, stars beyond stars,
worlds beyond worlds, is a true expression of the Infinite Being.
Does it follow, because the universe has no limits,--that it
must therefore be eternal, immense, infinite as God himself?
No; that is but a vain scruple, which springs from the imagination,
and not from the reason. The imagination is always
confounding what reason should ever distinguish, eternity and
time, immensity and space, <i>relative</i> infinity and <i>absolute</i> infinity.

<p>The introduction of the idea of "the mathematical infinite"
into metaphysical speculation, especially by Kant and Hamilton,
with the design, it would seem, of transforming the idea of
infinity into a sensuous conception, has generated innumerable
paralogisms which disfigure the pages of their philosophical
writings. This procedure is grounded in the common fallacy
of supposing that <i>infinity</i> and <i>quantity</i> are compatible attributes,
and susceptible of mathematical synthesis. This insidious and

plausible error is ably refuted by a writer in the "North American

<p>Mathematics is conversant with quantities and quantitative
relations. The conception of quantity, therefore, if rigorously
analyzed, will indicate <i>à priori</i> the natural and impassable
boundaries of the science; while a subsequent examination of
the quantities called infinite in the mathematical sense, and of
the algebraic symbol of infinity, will be seen to verify the results
of this <i>á priori</i> analysis.</p>

<p>Quantity is that attribute of things in virtue of which they
are susceptible of exact mensuration. The question <i>how much</i>,
or <i>how many</i> (<i>quantus</i>), implies the answer, <i>so much</i>, or <i>so many</i>
(<i>tantus</i>); but the answer is possible only through reference to
some standard of magnitude or multitude arbitrarily assumed.
Every object, therefore, of which quantity, in the mathematical
sense, is predicable, must be by its essential nature <i>mensurable.</i>
Now mensurability implies the existence of actual, definite limits,
since without them there could be no fixed relation between
the given object and the standard of measurement, and, consequently,
no possibility of exact mensuration. In fact, since
quantification is the object of all mathematical operations,
mathematics may be not inaptly defined as <i>the science of the determinations
of limits</i>. It is evident, therefore, that the terms
<i>quantity</i> and <i>finitude</i> express the same attribute, namely, <i>limitation</i>--the
former relatively, the latter absolutely; for quantity is
limitation considered with relation to some standard of measurement,
and finitude is limitation considered simply in itself.
The sphere of quantity, therefore, is absolutely identical with
the sphere of the finite; and the phrase <i>infinite quantity</i>, if
strictly construed, is a contradiction in terms.</p>

<p>The result thus attained by considering abstract quantity
is corroborated by considering concrete and discrete quantities.
Such expressions as <i>infinite sphere, radius, parallelogram, line,</i>
and so forth, are self-contradictory. A sphere is limited by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="181">181</a></span>
own periphery, and a radius by the centre and circumference
of its circle. A parallelogram of infinite altitude is impossible,
because the limit of its altitude is assigned in the side which
must be parallel to its base in order to constitute it a parallelogram.
In brief, all figuration is limitation. The contradiction
in the term <i>infinite line</i> is not quite so obvious, but can readily
be made apparent. Objectively, a line is only the termination
of a surface, and a surface the termination of a solid; hence a
line can not exist apart from an extended quantity, nor an infinite
line apart from an infinite quantity. But as this term has
just been shown to be self-contradictory, an infinite line can
not exist objectively at all. Again, every line is extension in
one dimension; hence a mathematical quantity, hence mensurable,
hence finite; you must therefore, deny that a line is a
quantity, or else affirm that it is finite.</p>

<p>The same conclusion is forced upon us, if from geometry
we turn to arithmetic. The phrases <i>infinite number, infinite series,
infinite process</i>, and so forth, are all contradictory when
literally construed. Number is a relation among separate unities
or integers, which, considered objectively as independent
of our cognitive powers, must constitute an exact sum; and
this exactitude, or synthetic totality, is limitation. If considered
subjectively in the mode of its cognition, a number is infinite
only in the sense that it is beyond the power of our imagination
or conception, which is an abuse of the term. In
either case the totality is fixed; that is, finite. So, too, of <i>series</i>
and <i>process</i>. Since every series involves a succession of terms
or numbers, and every process a succession of steps or stages,
the notion of series and process plainly involves that of <i>number</i>,
and must be rigorously dissociated from the idea of infinity.
At any one step, at any one term, the number attained is determinate,
hence finite. The fact that, by the law of the series
or of the process, <i>we</i> may continue the operation <i>as long as we
please</i>, does not justify the application of the term infinite to
the operation itself; if any thing is infinite, it is the will which
continues the operation, which is absurd if said of human wills.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="182">182</a></span>

<p>Consequently, the attribute of infinity is not predicable either
of 'diminution without limit,' 'augmentation without limit,' or
'endless approximation to a fixed limit,' for these mathematical
processes continue only as we continue them, consist of
steps successively accomplished, and are limited by the very
fact of this serial incompletion.</p>

<p>"We can not forbear pointing out an important application
of these results to the Critical Philosophy. Kant bases each
of his famous four antinomies on the demand of pure reason
for unconditioned totality in a regressive series of conditions.
This, he says, must be realized either in an absolute first of the
series, conditioning all the other members, but itself unconditioned,
or else in the absolute infinity of the series without a
first; but reason is utterly unable, on account of mutual contradiction,
to decide in which of the two alternatives the unconditioned
is found. By the principles we have laid down, however,
the problem is solved. The absolute infinity of a series
is a contradiction <i>in adjecto</i>. As every number, although immeasurably
and inconceivably great, is impossible unless <i>unity</i>
is given as its basis, so every series, being itself a number, is
impossible unless a <i>first term</i> is given as a commencement.
Through a first term alone is the unconditioned possible; that
is, if it does not exist in a first term, it can not exist at all; of
the two alternatives, therefore, one altogether disappears, and
reason is freed from the dilemma of a compulsory yet impossible
decision. Even if it should be allowed that the series has
no first term, but has originated <i>ab œterno</i>, it must always at
each instant have a <i>last term</i>; the series, as a whole, can not
be infinite, and hence can not, as Kant claims it can, realize in
its wholeness unconditioned totality. Since countless terms
forever remain unreached, the series is forever limited by them.
Kant himself admits that it <i>can never be completed</i>, and is only
potentially infinite; actually, therefore, by his own admission, it
is finite. But a last term implies a first, as absolutely as one end
of a string implies the other; the only possibility of an unconditioned
lies in Kant's first alternative, and if, as he maintains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="183">183</a></span>
Reason must demand it, she can not hesitate in her decisions.
That <i>number is a limitation</i> is no new truth, and that every series
involves number is self-evident; and it is surprising that so
radical a criticism on Kant's system should never have suggested
itself to his opponents. Even the so-called <i>moments</i>
of time can not be regarded as constituting a real series, for a
series can not be real except through its divisibility into members
whereas time is indivisible, and its partition into moments
is a conventional fiction. Exterior limitability and interior
divisibility result equally from the possibility of discontinuity.
Exterior illimitability and interior indivisibility are simple
phases of the same attribute of <i>necessary continuity</i> contemplated
under different aspects. From this principle flows another
upon which it is impossible to lay too much stress, namely;
<i>illimitability and indivisibility, infinity and unity, reciprocally necessitate
each other</i>. Hence the Quantitative Infinites must be
also Units, and the division of space and time, implying absolute
contradiction, is not even cogitable as an hypothesis.<a id="footnotetag220" name="footnotetag220"></a>
<a href="#footnote220"><sup class="sml">220</sup></a></p>

<p>"The word <i>infinite</i>, therefore, in mathematical usage, as applied
to <i>process</i> and to <i>quantity</i>, has a two-fold signification.
An infinite process is one which we can continue <i>as long as we
please</i>, but which exists solely in our continuance of it.<a id="footnotetag221" name="footnotetag221"></a>
<a href="#footnote221"><sup class="sml">221</sup></a> An
infinite quantity is one which exceeds our powers of mensuration
or of conception, but which, nevertheless, has bounds and
limits in itself.<a id="footnotetag222" name="footnotetag222"></a>
<a href="#footnote222"><sup class="sml">222</sup></a> Hence the possibility of relation among infinite
quantities, and of different orders of infinities. If the words
<i>infinite, infinity, infinitesimal</i>, should be banished from mathematical
treatises and replaced by the words <i>indefinite, indefinity,</i>
and <i>indefinitesimal</i>, mathematics would suffer no loss, while, by
removing a perpetual source of confusion, metaphysics would
get great gain."</p>

<p>The above must be regarded as a complete refutation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="184">184</a></span>
position taken by <i>Hume</i>, to wit, that the idea of nature eternally
existing in a state of order, without a cause other than the
eternally inherent laws of nature, is no more self-contradictory
than the idea of an eternally-existing and infinite mind, who
originated this order--a God existing without a cause. The
eternal and infinite Mind is indivisible and illimitable; nature,
in its totality, as well as in its individual parts, has interior divisibility,
and exterior limitability. The infinity of God is not
a <i>quantitative</i>, but a <i>qualitative</i> infinity. The miscalled eternity
and infinity of nature is an <i>indefinite</i> extension and protension
in time and space, and, as <i>quantitative</i>, must necessarily be limited
and measurable, therefore <i>finite</i>.</p>

<p>The universe of sense-perception and sensuous imagination
is a phenomenal universe, a genesis, a perpetual becoming, an
entrance into existence, and an exit thence; the Theist is,
therefore, perfectly justified in regarding it as disqualified for
<i>self-existence</i>, and in passing behind it for the Supreme Entity
that needs no cause. Phenomena demand causation, entities
dispense with it. No one asks for a cause of the <i>space</i> which
contains the universe, or of the Eternity on the bosom of which
it floats. Everywhere the line is necessarily drawn upon the
same principle; that entities <i>may</i> have self-existence, phenomena
<i>must</i> have a cause.<a id="footnotetag223" name="footnotetag223"></a>

<p>IV. <i>Psychological analysis clearly attests that in the phenomena
of consciousness there are found elements or principles which, in
their regular and normal development, transcend the limits of consciousness,
and attain to the knowledge of Absolute Being, Absolute
Reason, Absolute Good</i>, i.e., GOD.</p>

<p>The analysis of thought clearly reveals that the mind of man
is in possession of ideas, notions, beliefs, principles (as <i>e.g.</i>, the
idea of space, duration, cause, substance, unity, infinity), which
are not derived from sensation and experience, and which can
not be drawn out of sensation and experience by any process
of generalization. These ideas have this incontestable peculiarity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="185">185</a></span>
as distinguished from all the phenomena of sensation, that,
whilst the latter are particular, contingent, and relative, the
former are <i>universal</i>, <i>necessary</i>, and <i>absolute</i>. As an example,
and a proof of the reality and validity of this distinction, take
the ideas of <i>body</i> and of <i>space</i>, the former unquestionably derived
from experience, the latter supplied by reason alone. "I ask
you, can not you conceive this book to be destroyed? Without
doubt you can. And can not you conceive the whole world to
be destroyed, and no matter whatever in existence? You can.
For you, constituted as you are, the supposition of the non-existence
of bodies implies no contradiction. And what do we
call the idea of a thing which we can conceive of as non-existing?
We call it a <i>contingent</i> and <i>relative</i> idea. But if you can
conceive this book to be destroyed, all bodies destroyed, can
you suppose space to be destroyed? You can not. It is in the
power of man's thought to conceive the non-existence of bodies;
it is not in the power of man's thought to conceive the
non-existence of space. The idea of space is thus a <i>necessary</i>
and <i>absolute</i> idea."<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a>

<p>Take, again, the ideas of <i>event</i> and <i>cause</i>. The idea of an
event is a <i>contingent</i> idea; it is the idea of something which
might or might not have happened. There is no impossibility
or contradiction in either supposition. The idea of cause is a
<i>necessary</i> idea. An event being given, the idea of cause is necessarily
implied. An uncaused event is an impossible conception.
The idea of cause is also a <i>universal</i> idea extending to
all events, actual or conceivable, and affirmed by all minds.
It is a rational fact, attested by universal consciousness, that
we can not think of an event transpiring without a cause; of a
thing being the author of its own existence; of something generated
by and out of nothing. <i>Ex nihilo nihil</i> is a universal
law of thought and of things. This universal "law of causality"
is clearly distinguishable from a <i>general</i> truth reached by
induction. For example, it is a very general truth that, during
twenty-four hours, day is succeeded by night. But this is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="186">186</a></span>
a necessary truth, neither is it a universal truth. It does not
extend to all known lands, as, for example, to Nova Zembla.
It does not hold true of the other planets. Nor does it extend
to all possible lands. We can easily conceive of lands plunged
in eternal night, or rolling in eternal day. With another system
of worlds, one can conceive other physics, but one can not
conceive other metaphysics. It is impossible to imagine a
world in which the law of causality does not reign. Here,
then, we have one absolute principle (among others which may
be enumerated), the existence and reality of which is revealed,
not by sensation, but by reason--a principle which transcends
the limits of experience, and which, in its regular and logical
development, attains the knowledge of the Absolute Cause--the
First Cause of all causes--God.</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that the human mind is in possession of
two distinct orders of primitive cognitions,--one, contingent,
relative, and phenomenal; the other universal, necessary, and
absolute. These two distinct orders of cognition presuppose
the existence in man of two distinct faculties or organs of
knowledge--<i>sensation</i>, external and internal, which perceives
the contingent, relative, and phenomenal, and <i>reason</i>, which apprehends
the universal, necessary, and absolute. The knowledge
which is derived from sensation and experience is called
<i>empirical</i> knowledge, or knowledge <i>à posteriori</i>, because subsequent
to, and consequent upon, the exercise of the faculties of
observation. The knowledge derived from reason is called
<i>transcendental</i> knowledge, or knowledge <i>à priori</i>, because it furnishes
laws to, and governs the exercise of the faculties of observation
and thought, and is not the result of their exercise.
The sensibility brings the mind into relation with the <i>physical</i>
world, the reason puts mind in communication with the <i>intelligible</i>
world--the sphere of <i>à priori</i> principles, of necessary
and absolute truths, which depend upon neither the world nor
the conscious self, and which reveal to man the existence of
the soul, nature, and God. Every distinct fact of consciousness
is thus at once <i>psychological</i> and <i>ontological</i>, and contains these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="187" >187</a></span>
three fundamental ideas, which we can not go beyond, or cancel
by any possible analysis--the <i>soul</i>, with its faculties; <i>matter</i>,
with its qualities; <i>God</i>, with his perfections.</p>

<p>We do not profess to be able to give a clear explication and
complete enumeration of all the ideas of reason, and of the necessary
and universal principles or axioms which are grounded
on these ideas. This is still the grand desideratum of metaphysical
science. Its achievement will give us a primordial
logic, which shall be as exact in its procedure and as certain
in its conclusions as the mathematical sciences. Meantime,
it may be affirmed that philosophic analysis, in the person
of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Cousin, has succeeded in disengaging
such <i>à priori</i> ideas, and formulating such principles
and laws of thought, as lead infallibly to the cognition of the
<i>Absolute Being</i>, the <i>Absolute Reason</i>, the <i>Absolute Good</i>, that is,
GOD.</p>

<p>It would carry us too far beyond our present design were
we to exhibit, in each instance, the process of <i>immediate abstraction</i>
by which the contingent and relative element of knowledge
is eliminated, and the necessary and absolute principle
is disengaged. We shall simply state the method, and show
its application by a single illustration.</p>

<p>There are unquestionably <i>two</i> sorts of abstraction: 1. "<i>Comparative</i>
abstraction, operating upon several real objects, and
seizing their resemblances in order to form an abstract idea,
which is collective and mediate; collective, because different
individuals concur in its formation; mediate, because it requires
several intermediate operations." This is the method
of the physical sciences, which comprises comparison, abstraction,
and generalization. The result in this process is the attainment
of a <i>general</i> truth. 2. "<i>Immediate</i> abstraction, not
comparative; operating not upon several concretes, but upon a
single one, eliminating and neglecting its individual and variable
part, and disengaging the absolute part, which it raises at
once to its pure form." The parts to be eliminated in a concrete
cognition are, first, the quality of the object, and the circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="188">188</a></span>
under which the absolute unfolds itself; and secondly,
the quality of the subject, which perceives but does not
constitute it. The phenomena of the me and the not-me being
eliminated, the absolute remains. This is the process of rational
psychology, and the result obtained is a <i>universal</i> and
<i>necessary</i> truth.</p>

<p>"Let us take, as an example, the principle of cause. To be
able to say that the event I see must have a cause, it is not
indispensable to have seen several events succeed each other.
The principle which compels me to pronounce this judgment
is already complete in the first as in the last event; it can not
change in respect to its object, it can not change in itself; it
neither increases nor decreases with the greater or less number
of applications. The only difference that it is subject to
in regard to us is that we apply it, whether we remark it or not,
whether we disengage it or not from its particular application.
The question is not to eliminate the particularity of the phenomenon
wherein it appears to us, whether it be the fall of a
leaf or the murder of a man, in order immediately to conceive,
in a general and abstract manner, the necessity of a cause for
every event that begins to exist. Here it is not because I am
the same, or have been affected in the same manner in several
different cases, that I have come to this general and abstract
conception. A leaf falls; at the same moment I think, I believe,
I declare that this falling of the leaf must have a cause.
A man has been killed; at the same instant I believe, I proclaim
that this death must have a cause. Each one of these
facts contains particular and variable circumstances, and something
universal and necessary, to wit, both of them can not but
have a cause. Now I am perfectly able to disengage the universal
from the particular in regard to the first fact as well as
in regard to the second fact, for the universal is in the first
quite as well as in the second. In fact, if the principle of
causality is not universal in the first fact, neither will it be in
the second, nor in the third, nor in the thousandth; for a thousandth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="189">189</a></span>
is not nearer than the first to the infinite--to absolute
universality. It is the same, and still more evidently, with
<i>necessity</i>. Pay particular attention to this point; if necessity is
not in the first fact, it can not be in any; for necessity can not
be formed little by little, and by successive increments. If, on
the first murder I see, I do not exclaim that this murder had
necessarily a cause, at the thousandth murder, although it shall
be proved that all the others had causes, I shall have the right
to think that this murder has, very probably, also a cause, but
I shall never have the right to say that it <i>necessarily</i> had a
cause. But when universality and necessity are already in a
single case, that case is sufficient to entitle me to deduce them
from it,"<a id="footnotetag225" name="footnotetag225"></a>
<a href="#footnote225"><sup class="sml">225</sup></a> and we may add, also, to affirm them of every other

<p>The following <i>schema</i> will exhibit the generally accepted results
of this method of analysis applied to the phenomena of
thought:</p>

<p>(i.) <i>Universal and necessary principles, or primitive judgments
from whence is derived the cognition of Absolute Being</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>The principle of Substance</i>; thus enounced--"every
quality supposes a <i>subject</i> or real being."</p>

<p>2. <i>The principle of Causality</i>; "every thing that begins to
be supposes a <i>power</i> adequate to its production, <i>i.e.</i>, an efficient
cause."</p>

<p>3. <i>The principle of Unity</i>; "all differentiation and plurality
supposes an incomposite unity; all diversity, an ultimate and
indivisible identity."</p>

<p>4. <i>The principle of the Unconditioned</i>; "the finite supposes
the infinite, the dependent supposes the self-existent, the
temporal supposes the eternal."</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Universal and necessary principles, or primitive judgments,
from which is derived the cognition of the Absolute Reason</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>The principle of Ideality</i>; thus enounced, "facts of order--definite
proportion, symmetrical arrangement, numerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="190" >190</a></span>
relation, geometrical form--having a commencement in time,
present themselves to us as the expression of <i>Ideas</i>, and refer
us to <i>Mind</i> as their analogon, and exponent, and source."</p>

<p>2. <i>The principle of Consecution</i>; "the uniform succession
and progressive evolution of new existences, according to fixed
definite archetypes, suppose a unity of <i>thought</i>--a comprehensive
<i>plan</i> embracing all existence."</p>

<p>3. <i>The principle of Intentionality or Final Cause</i>; "every
means supposes an <i>end</i> contemplated, and a choice and
adaptation of means to secure the <i>end</i>."</p>

<p>4. <i>The principle of Personality</i>; "intelligent purpose and
voluntary choice imply a personal agent."</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Universal and necessary principles, or primitive judgments,
from whence is derived the cognition of the Absolute Good</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>The principle of Moral Law</i>; thus enounced, "the action
of a voluntary agent necessarily characterized as <i>right</i> or
<i>wrong</i>, supposes an immutable and universal standard of
right--an absolute moral Law."</p>

<p>2. <i>The principle of Moral Obligation</i>; "the feeling of obligation
to obey a law of duty supposes a <i>Lawgiver</i> by whose
authority we are obliged."</p>

<p>3. <i>The principle of Moral Desert</i>; "the feeling of personal
accountability and of moral desert supposes a <i>judge</i> to whom
we must give account, and who shall determine our award."</p>

<p>4. <i>The pnnciple of Retribution</i>; "retributive issues in this
life, and the existence in all minds of an impersonal justice
which demands that, in the final issue, every being shall receive
his just deserts, suppose a being of <i>absolute justice</i>
who shall render to every man according to his works."</p>

<p>A more profound and exhaustive analysis may perhaps resolve
all these primitive judgments into one universal principle
or law, which Leibnitz has designated "<i>The principle or law
of sufficient reason</i>," and which is thus enounced--there must
be an ultimate and sufficient reason why any thing exists, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="191">191</a></span>
why it is, rather than otherwise; that is, if any thing
begins to be, something else must be supposed as the adequate
ground, and reason, and cause of its existence; or again, to
state the law in view of our present discussion, "<i>if the finite
universe, with its existing order and arrangement, had a beginning,
there must be an ultimate and sufficient reason why it exists, and
why it is as it is, rather than otherwise</i>." In view of one particular
class of phenomena, or special order of facts, this "principle
of sufficient reason" may be varied in the form of its statement,
and denominated "the principle of substance," "the
principle of causality," "the principle of intentionality," etc.;
and, it may be, these are but specific judgments under the one
fundamental and generic law of thought which constitutes the
<i>major</i> premise of every Theistic syllogism.</p>

<p>These fundamental principles, primitive judgments, axioms,
or necessary and determinate forms of thought, exist potentially
or germinally in all human minds; they are spontaneously
developed in presence of the phenomena of the universe,
material and mental; they govern the original movement of the
mind, even when not appearing in consciousness in their pure
and abstract form; and they compel us to affirm <i>a permanent
being</i> or <i>reality</i> behind all phenomena--a <i>power</i> adequate to
the production of change, back of all events; a <i>personal Mind</i>,
as the explanation of all the facts of order, and uniform succession,
and regular evolution; and a <i>personal Lawgiver</i> and
<i>Righteous Judge</i> as the ultimate ground and reason of all the
phenomena of the moral world; in short, to affirm <i>an Unconditioned
Cause of all finite and secondary causes; a First Principle
of all principles; an Ultimate Reason of all reasons; an immutable
Uncreated Justice, the living light of conscience; a King
immortal, eternal, invisible, the only wise God, the ruler of the
world and man</i>.</p>

<p>Our position, then, is, that the idea of God is revealed to
man in the natural and spontaneous development of his intelligence,
and that the existence of a Supreme Reality corresponding
to, and represented by this idea, is rationally and logically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="192">192</a></span>
demonstrable, and therefore justly entitled to take rank as part
of our legitimate, valid, and positive <i>knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>And now from this position, which we regard as impregnable,
we shall be prepared more deliberately and intelligibly to
contemplate the various assaults which are openly or covertly
made upon the doctrine that <i>God is cognizable by human reason</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="193">193</a></span>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h3>THE UNKNOWN GOD (<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<h3>IS GOD COGNIZABLE BY REASON?</h3>

<p>"The abnegation of reason is not the evidence of faith, but the confession
of despair."--LIGHTFOOT.</p>

<p>At the outset of this inquiry we attempted a hasty grouping
of the various parties and schools which are arrayed
against the doctrine that God is cognizable by human reason,
and in general terms we sought to indicate the ground they
occupy.</p>

<p>Viewed from a philosophical stand-point, we found one party
marshalled under the standard of Idealism; another of Materialism
and, again, another of Natural Realism. Regarded
in their theological aspects, some are positive Atheists; others,
strange to say, are earnest Theists; whilst others occupy a position
of mere Indifferentism. Yet, notwithstanding the remarkable
diversity, and even antagonism of their philosophical and
theological opinions, they are all agreed in denying to reason
any valid cognition of God.</p>

<p>The survey of Natural Theism we have completed in the
previous chapter will enable us still further to indicate the
exact points against which their attacks are directed, and also
to estimate the character and force of the weapons employed.
With or without design, they are, each in their way, assailing
one or other of the principles upon which we rest our demonstration
of the being of God. As we proceed, we shall find
that Mill and the Constructive Idealists are really engaged in
undermining "the <i>principle of substance</i>;" their doctrine is a
virtual denial of all objective realities answering to our subjective
ideas of matter, mind, and God. The assaults of Comte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="194">194</a></span>
and the Materialists of his school are mainly directed against
"<i>the principle of causality</i>" and "<i>the principle of intentionality</i>;"
they would deny to man all knowledge of causes, efficient and
final. The attacks of Hamilton and his school are directed
against "the <i>principle of the unconditioned</i>," his philosophy of
the conditioned is a plausible attempt to deprive man of all
power to think the Infinite and Perfect, to conceive the Unconditioned
and Ultimate Cause; whilst the Dogmatic Theologians
are borrowing, and recklessly brandishing, the weapons of all
these antagonists, and, in addition to all this, are endeavoring
to show the insufficiency of "<i>the principle of unity</i>" and the
weakness and invalidity of "the <i>moral principles</i>," which are regarded
by us as relating man to a Moral Personality, and as
indicating to him the existence of a righteous God, the ruler of
the world. It is necessary, therefore, that we should concentrate
our attention yet more specifically on these separate lines of attack,
and attempt a minuter examination of the positions assumed
by each, and of the arguments by which they are seeking,
directly or indirectly, to invalidate the fundamental principles
of Natural Theism.</p>

<p>(i.) <i>We commence with the Idealistic School</i>, of which John Stuart
Mill must be regarded as the ablest living representative.</p>

<p>The doctrine of this school is that all our knowledge is necessarily
confined to <i>mental</i> phenomena; that is, "to <i>feelings</i> or
states of consciousness," and "the succession and co-existence,
the likeness and unlikeness between these feelings or states of
consciousness."<a id="footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a>
<a href="#footnote226"><sup class="sml">226</sup></a> All our general notions, all our abstract
ideas, are generated out of these feelings<a id="footnotetag227" name="footnotetag227"></a>
<a href="#footnote227"><sup class="sml">227</sup></a> by "<i>inseparable association</i>,"
which registers their inter-relations of recurrence, co-existence,
and resemblance. The results of this inseparable
association constitute at once the sum total and the absolute
limit of all possible cognition.</p>

"feeling." "Feeling, in the proper sense of the term, is a genus of which
Sensation, Emotion, and Thought are the subordinate species."--"Logic,"
bk. i. ch. iii. § 3.</blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="195">195</a></span>

<p>It is admitted by Mill that one <i>apparent</i> element in this total
result is the general conviction that our own existence is
really distinct from the external world, and that the personal <i>ego</i>
has an essential identity distinct from the fleeting phenomena
of sensation. But this persuasion is treated by him as a mere
illusion--a leap beyond the original datum for which we have
no authority. Of a real substance or substratum called Mind,
of a real substance or substratum called Matter, underlying the
series of feelings--"the thread of consciousness"--we do know
and can know nothing; and in affirming the existence of such
substrata we are making a supposition we can not possibly
verify. The ultimate datum of speculative philosophy is not
"<i>I think</i>," but simply "<i>Thoughts or feelings are</i>." The belief
in a permanent subject or substance, called matter, as the
ground and plexus of physical phenomena, and of a permanent
subject or substance, called mind, as the ground and plexus of
mental phenomena, is not a primitive and original intuition οf
reason. It is simply through the action of the principle of association
among the ultimate phenomena, called feelings, that
this (erroneous) separation of the phenomena into two orders
or aggregates--one called mind or self; the other matter, or
not self--takes place; and without this curdling or associating
process no such notion or belief could have been generated.
"The principle of substance," as an ultimate law of thought, is,
therefore, to be regarded as a transcendental dream.</p>

<p>But now that the notion of <i>mind</i> or <i>self</i>, and of <i>matter</i> or
not <i>self</i>, do exist as common convictions of our race, what is
philosophy to make of them? After a great many qualifications
and explanations, Mr. Mill has, in his "Logic," summed up his
doctrine of Constructive Idealism in the following words: "As
body is the mysterious <i>something</i> which excites the mind to feel,
so mind is the mysterious <i>something</i> which feels and thinks."<a id="footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a>
<a href="#footnote228"><sup class="sml">228</sup></a>
But what is this "mysterious something?" Is it a reality, an
entity, a subject; or is it a shadow, an illusion, a dream? In
his "Examination of Sir Wm. Hamilton's Philosophy," where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="196">196</a></span>
it may be presumed, we have his maturest opinions, Mr. Mill,
in still more abstract and idealistic phraseology, attempts an
answer. Here he defines matter as "<i>a permanent possibility
of sensation</i>,"<a id="footnotetag229" name="footnotetag229"></a>
<a href="#footnote229"><sup class="sml">229</sup></a> and mind as "<i>a permanent possibility of feeling</i>."<a id="footnotetag230" name="footnotetag230"></a>
<a href="#footnote230"><sup class="sml">230</sup></a>
And "the belief in these permanent possibilities," he assures
us, "includes all that is essential or characteristic in the belief
in substance."<a id="footnotetag231" name="footnotetag231"></a>
<a href="#footnote231"><sup class="sml">231</sup></a> "If I am asked," says he, "whether I believe
in matter, I ask whether the questioner accepts this definition
of it. If he does, I believe in matter: and so do all Berkeleians.
In any other sense than this, I do not. But I affirm with confidence
that this conception of matter includes the whole
meaning attached to it by the common world, apart from philosophical,
and sometimes from theological theories. The reliance
of mankind on the real existence of visible and tangible
objects, means reliance on the reality and permanence of possibilities
of visual and tactual sensations, when no sensations
are actually experienced."<a id="footnotetag232" name="footnotetag232"></a>
<a href="#footnote232"><sup class="sml">232</sup></a> "Sensations," however, let it be
borne in mind, are but a subordinate species of the genus feeling.<a id="footnotetag233" name="footnotetag233"></a>
<a href="#footnote233"><sup class="sml">233</sup></a>
They are "states of consciousness"--phenomena of
mind, not of matter; and we are still within the impassable
boundary of ideal phenomena; we have yet no cognition of an
external world. The sole cosmical conception, for us, is still a
succession of sensations, or states of consciousness. This is
the one phenomenon which we can not transcend in knowledge,
do what we will; all else is hypothesis and illusion. The
<i>non-ego</i>, after all, then, may be but a mode in which the mind
represents to itself the possible modifications of the <i>ego</i>.</p>

<p>And now that matter, as a real existence, has disappeared
under Mr. Mill's analysis, what shall be said of mind or self?
Is there any permanent subject or real entity underlying the
phenomena of feeling? In feeling, is there a personal self that
feels, thinks, and wills? It would seem not. Mind, as well as
matter, resolves itself into a "series of feelings," varying and
fugitive from moment to moment, in a sea of possibilities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="197">197</a></span>
feeling. "My mind," says Mill, "is but a series of feelings,
or, as it has been called, a thread of consciousness, however
supplemented by believed possibilities of consciousness, which
are not, though they might be, realized."<a id="footnotetag234" name="footnotetag234"></a>

<p>The ultimate fact of the phenomenal world, then, in the
philosophy of Mill, is neither matter nor mind, but feelings or
states of consciousness associated together by the relations,
amongst themselves, of recurrence, co-existence, and resemblance.
The existence of self, except as "a series of feelings;"
the existence of any thing other than self, except as a
feigned unknown cause of sensation, is rigorously denied. Mr.
Mill does not content himself with saying that we are ignorant
of the <i>nature</i> of matter and mind, but he asserts we are ignorant
of the <i>existence</i> of matter and mind as real entities.</p>

<p>The bearing of this doctrine of Idealism upon Theism and
Theology will be instantly apparent to the reader. If I am necessarily
ignorant of the existence of the external world, and of
the personal <i>ego</i>, or real self, I must be equally ignorant of the
existence of God. If one is a mere supposition, an illusion, so
the other must be. Mr. Mill, however, is one of those courteous
and affable writers who are always conscious, as it were, of the
presence of their readers, and extremely careful not to shock
their feelings or prejudices; besides, he has too much conscious
self-respect to avow himself an atheist. As a speculative
philosopher, he would rather regard Theism and Theology
as "open questions," and he satisfies himself with saying, if you
believe in the existence of God, or in Christianity, I do not interfere
with you. "As a theory," he tells us that his doctrine
leaves the evidence of the existence of God exactly as it was
before. Supposing me to believe that the Divine mind is simply
the series of the Divine thoughts and feelings prolonged
through eternity, that would be, at any rate, believing God's existence
to be <i>as real as my own</i><a id="footnotetag235" name="footnotetag235"></a>
<a href="#footnote235"><sup class="sml">235</sup></a>. And as for evidence, the
argument of Paley's 'Natural Theology,' or, for that matter, of
his 'Evidences of Christianity,' would stand exactly as it does.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="198">198</a></span>

<p>The design argument is drawn from the analogies of human experience.
From the relation which human works bear to human
thoughts and feelings, it infers a corresponding relation
between works more or less similar, but superhuman, and superhuman
thoughts and feelings. <i>If</i> it prove these, nobody
but a metaphysician needs care whether or not it proves a
mysterious <i>substratum</i> for them.<a id="footnotetag236" name="footnotetag236"></a>
<a href="#footnote236"><sup class="sml">236</sup></a> The argument from design,
it seems to us, however, would have no validity if there be no
external world offering marks of design. If the external world
is only a mode of feeling, a series of mental states, then our
notion of the Divine Existence may be only "an association
of feelings"--a mode of Self. And if we have no positive
knowledge of a real self as existing, and God's existence is no
more "real than our own," then the Divine existence stands on
a very dubious and uncertain foundation. It can have no very
secure hold upon the human mind, and certainly has no claim
to be regarded as a fundamental and necessary belief. That
it has a very precarious hold upon the mind of Mr. Mill, is evident
from the following passage in his article on "<i>Later Speculations
of A. Comte</i>."<a id="footnotetag237" name="footnotetag237"></a>
<a href="#footnote237"><sup class="sml">237</sup></a> "We venture to think that a religion
may exist without a belief in a God, and that a religion without
a God may be, even to Christians, an instructive and profitable
object of contemplation."</p>

<p>And now let us close Mr. Mill's book, and, introverting our
mental gaze, interrogate <i>consciousness</i>, the verdict of which, even
Mr. Mill assures us, is admitted on all hands to be a decision
without appeal.<a id="footnotetag238" name="footnotetag238"></a>

<p>1. We have an ineradicable, and, as it would seem, an intuitive
faith in the real existence of an external world distinct
from our sensations, and also of a personal self, which we call
"I," "myself," as distinct from "my sensations," and "my
feelings." We find, also, that this is confessedly the common
belief of mankind. There have been a few philosophers who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="199">199</a></span>
have affected to treat this belief as a "mere prejudice," an
"illusion;" but they have never been able, practically, so to
regard and treat it. Their language, just as plainly as the language
of the common people, betrays their instinctive faith in
an outer world, and proves their utter inability to emancipate
themselves from this "prejudice," if such it may please them to
call it. In view of this acknowledged fact, we ask--Does the
term "<i>permanent possibility of sensations</i>" exhaust all that is
contained in this conception of an external world? This evening
I <i>remember</i> that at noonday I beheld the sun, and experienced
a sensation of warmth whilst exposing myself to his rays;
and I <i>expect</i> that to-morrow, under the same conditions, I shall
experience the same sensations. I now <i>remember</i> that last
evening I extinguished my light and attempted to leave my
study, but, coming in contact with the closed door, experienced
a sense of resistance to my muscular effort, by a solid and extended
body exterior to myself; and I <i>expect</i> that this evening,
under the same circumstances, I shall experience the same
sensations. Now, does a belief in "a permanent possibility of
sensations" explain all these experiences? does it account for
that immediate knowledge of an <i>external</i> object which I had
on looking at the sun, or that presentative knowledge of <i>resistance</i>
and <i>extension</i>, and of an extended, resisting <i>substance</i>, I had
when in contact with the door of my study? Mr. Mill very
confidently affirms that this belief includes all; and this phrase
expresses all the meaning attached to extended "matter" and
resisting "substance" by the common world.<a id="footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a>
<a href="#footnote239"><sup class="sml">239</sup></a> We as confidently
affirm that it does no such thing; and as "the common
world" must be supposed to understand the language of consciousness
as well as the philosopher, we are perfectly willing
to leave the decision of that question to the common consciousness
of our race. If all men do not believe in a permanent
<i>reality</i>--a substance which is external to themselves, a substance
which offers resistance to their muscular effort, and
which produces in them the sensations of solidity, extension,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="200">200</a></span>
resistance, etc.--they believe nothing and know nothing at all
about the matter.</p>

<p>Still less does the phrase "<i>a permanent possibility of feelings"</i>
exhaust all our conception of a personal self. Recurring to the
experiences of yesterday, I <i>remember</i> the feelings I experienced
on beholding the sun, and also on pressing against the closed
door, and I confidently <i>expect</i> the recurrence, under the same
circumstances, of the same feelings. Does the belief in "a
permanent possibility of feelings" explain the act of memory
by which I recall the past event, and the act of prevision by
which I anticipate the recurrence of the like experience in the
future? Who or what is the "I" that remembers and the "I"
that anticipates? The "ego," the personal mind, is, according
to Mill, a mere "series of feelings," or, more correctly, a flash
of "<i>present</i> feelings" on "a background of possibilities of present
feelings."<a id="footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a>
<a href="#footnote240"><sup class="sml">240</sup></a> If, then, there be no permanent substance or
reality which is the subject of the present feeling, which receives
and retains the impress of the past feeling, and which
anticipates the recurrence of like feelings in the future, how can
the <i>past</i> be recalled, how distinguished from the present? and
how, without a knowledge of the past as distinguished from the
present, can the <i>future</i> be forecast? Mr. Mill feels the pressure
of this difficulty, and frankly acknowledges it. He admits
that, on the hypothesis that mind is simply "a series of feelings,"
the phenomena of memory and expectation are "inexplicable"
and "incomprehensible."<a id="footnotetag241" name="footnotetag241"></a>
<a href="#footnote241"><sup class="sml">241</sup></a> He is, therefore, under
the necessity of completing his definition of mind by adding
that it is a series of feelings which "<i>is aware of itself as a series</i>;"
and, still further, of supplementing this definition by the conjecture
that "<i>something which has ceased to exist, or is not yet in existence,
can still, in a manner, be present</i>."<a id="footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a>
<a href="#footnote242"><sup class="sml">242</sup></a> Now he who can understand
how a series of feelings can flow on in time, and from
moment to moment drop out of the present into non-existence,
and yet be <i>present</i> and <i>conscious of itself as a series</i>, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="201" >201</a></span>
accorded the honor of understanding Mr. Mill's definition of
mind or self, and may be permitted to rank himself as a distinguished
disciple of the Idealist school; for ourselves, we acknowledge
we are destitute of the capacity to do the one, and
of all ambition to be the other. And he who can conceive how
the <i>past</i> feeling of yesterday and the <i>possible</i> feeling of to-morrow
can be in any manner <i>present</i> to-day; or, in other words,
how any thing which has ceased to exist, or which never had an
existence, can <i>now</i> exist, may be permitted to believe that a
thing can be and not be at the same moment, that a part is
greater than the whole, and that two and two make five; but
we are not ashamed to confess our inability to believe a contradiction.
To our understanding, "possibilities of feeling" are
not actualities. They may or may not be realized, and until
realized in consciousness, they have no real being. If there be
no other background of mental phenomena save mere "possibilities
of feeling," then present feelings are the only existences,
the only reality, and a loss of immediate consciousness, as in
narcosis and coma, is the loss of all personality, all self-hood,
and of all real being.</p>

<p>2. What, then, is the verdict of consciousness as to the existence
of a permanent substance, an abiding existence which is
the subject of all the varying phenomena? Of what are we
really conscious when we say "I think," "I feel," "I will?" Are
we simply conscious of thought, feeling, and volition, or of a
self, a person, which thinks, feels, and wills? The man who
honestly and unreservedly accepts the testimony of consciousness
in all its integrity must answer at once, <i>we have an immediate
consciousness, not merely of the phenomena of mind, but of a
personal self as passively or actively related to the phenomena</i>. We
are conscious not merely of the act of volition, but of a self, a
power, producing the volition. We are conscious not merely
of feeling, but of a being who is the subject of the feeling. We
are conscious not simply of thought, but of a real entity that
thinks. "It is clearly a flat contradiction to maintain that I
am not immediately conscious of myself, but only of my sensations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="202">202</a></span>
or volitions. Who, then, is that <i>I</i> that is conscious, and
how can I be conscious of such states as <i>mine?</i>"<a id="footnotetag243" name="footnotetag243"></a>

<p>The testimony of consciousness, then, is indubitable that we
have a direct, immediate cognition of <i>self</i>--I know myself as a
distinctly existing being. This permanent self, to which I refer
the earlier and later stages of consciousness, the past as well as
the present feeling, and which I know abides the same under
all phenomenal changes, constitutes my personal identity. It
is this abiding self which unites the past and the present, and,
from the present stretches onward to the future. We know
self immediately, as existing, as in active operation, and as having
permanence--or, in other words, as a "<i>substance</i>." This
one immediately presented substance, myself, may be regarded
as furnishing a positive basis for that other notion of substance,
which is representatively thought, as the subject of all sensible
qualities.</p>

<p>3. We may now inquire what is the testimony of consciousness
as to the existence of the extra-mental world? Are we
conscious of perceiving external objects immediately and in
themselves, or only mediately through some vicarious image or
representative idea to which we fictitiously ascribe an objective
reality?</p>

<p>The answer of common sense is that we are immediately
conscious, in perception, of an <i>ego</i> and a <i>non-ego</i> known together,
and known in contrast to each other; we are conscious of a
perceiving subject, and of an external reality, as the object perceived.<a id="footnotetag244" name="footnotetag244"></a>
<a href="#footnote244"><sup class="sml">244</sup></a>
To state this doctrine of natural realism still more explicitly
we add, that we are conscious of the immediate perception
of certain essential attributes of matter objectively existing.
Of these primary qualities, which are immediately perceived
as real and objectively existing, we mention <i>extension</i> in
space and <i>resistance</i> to muscular effort, with which is indissolubly
associated the idea of <i>externality</i>. It is true that extension
and resistance are only qualities, but it is equally true that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="203" >203</a></span>
are qualities of something, and of something which is external
to ourselves. Let any one attempt to conceive of extension
without something which is extended, or of resistance apart from
something which offers resistance, and he will be convinced that
we can never know qualities without knowing substance, just as
we can not know substance without knowing qualities. This,
indeed, is admitted by Mr. Mill.<a id="footnotetag245" name="footnotetag245"></a>
<a href="#footnote245"><sup class="sml">245</sup></a> And if this be admitted, it
must certainly be absurd to speak of substance as something
"unknown." Substance is known just as much as quality is
known, no less and no more.</p>

<p>We remark, in conclusion, that if the testimony of consciousness
is not accepted in all its integrity, we are necessarily involved
in the Nihilism of Hume and Fichte; the phenomena
of mind and matter are, on analysis, resolved into an absolute
nothingness--"a play of phantasms in a void."<a id="footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a>
<a href="#footnote246"><sup class="sml">246</sup></a></p>

<p>(ii.) We turn, secondly, to the <i>Materialistic School</i> as represented
by Aug. Comte.</p>

<p>The doctrine of this school is that all knowledge is limited
to <i>material</i> phenomena--that is, to appearances <i>perceptible to
sense</i>. We do not know the essence of any object, nor the real
mode of procedure of any event, but simply its relations to other
events, as similar or dissimilar, co-existent or successive. These
relations are constant; under the same conditions, they are
always the same. The constant resemblances which link phenomena
together, and the constant sequences which unite them,
as antecedent and consequent, are termed <i>laws</i>. The laws of
phenomena are all we know respecting them. Their essential
nature and their ultimate causes, <i>efficient</i> or <i>final</i>, are unknown
and inscrutable to us.<a id="footnotetag247" name="footnotetag247"></a>

<p>It is not our intention to review the system of philosophy
propounded by Aug. Comte; we are now chiefly concerned
with his denial of all causation.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="204">204</a></span>

<p>1. <i>As to Efficient Causes</i>.--Had Comte contented himself with
the assertion that causes lie beyond the field of sensible observation,
and that inductive science can not carry us beyond
the relations of co-existence and succession among phenomena,
he would have stated an important truth, but certainly not a
new truth. It had already been announced by distinguished
mental philosophers, as, for example, M. de Biran and Victor
Cousin.<a id="footnotetag248" name="footnotetag248"></a>
<a href="#footnote248"><sup class="sml">248</sup></a> The senses give us only the succession of one phenomenon
to another. I hold a piece of wax to the fire and it
melts. Here my senses inform me of two successive phenomena--the
proximity of fire and the melting of wax. It is now agreed
among all schools of philosophy that this is all the knowledge
the senses can possibly supply. The observation of a great
number of like cases assures us that this relation is uniform.
The highest scientific generalization does not carry us one step
beyond this fact. Induction, therefore, gives us no access to
causes beyond phenomena. Still, this does not justify Comte
in the assertion that causes are to us absolutely <i>unknown</i>. The
question would still arise whether we have not some faculty of
knowledge, distinct from sensation, which is adequate to furnish
a valid cognition of cause. It does not by any means follow
that, because the idea of causation is not given as a "physical
quæsitum" at the end of a process of scientific generalization,
it should not be a "metaphysical datum" posited at the
very beginning of scientific inquiry, as the indispensable condition
of our being able to cognize phenomena at all, and as the
law under which all thought, and all conception of the system
of nature, is alone possible.</p>

<p>Now we affirm that the human mind has just as direct, immediate,
and positive knowledge of <i>cause</i> as it has of <i>effect.</i>
The idea of cause, the intuition <i>power</i>, is given in the immediate
consciousness of <i>mind as determining its own</i> operations.
Our first, and, in fact, our only presentation of power or cause,
is that of <i>self as willing</i>. In every act of volition I am fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="205">205</a></span>
conscious that it is in my power to form a resolution or to refrain
from it, to determine on this course of action or that; and
this constitutes the immediate presentative knowledge of power.<a id="footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a>
<a href="#footnote249"><sup class="sml">249</sup></a>
The will is a power, a power in action, a productive power,
and, consequently, a cause. This doctrine is stated with remarkable
clearness and accuracy by Cousin: "If we seek the
notion of cause in the action of one ball upon another, as was
previously done by Hume, or in the action of the hand upon
the ball, or the primary muscles upon the extremities, or even
in the action of the will upon the muscles, as was done by M.
Maine de Biran, we shall find it in none of these cases, not even
in the last; for it is possible there should be a paralysis of the
muscles which deprives the will of power over them, makes
it unproductive, incapable of being a cause, and, consequently,
of suggesting the notion of one. But what no paralysis can
prevent is the action of the will upon itself, the production of a
resolution; that is to say, the act of causation entirely mental,
the primitive type of all causality, of which all external movements
are only symbols more or less imperfect. The
first cause for us, is, therefore, the <i>will</i>, of which the first effect
is volition. This is at once the highest and the purest source
of the notion of cause, which thus becomes identical with that
of personality. And it is the taking possession, so to speak,
of the cause, as revealed in will and personality, which is the
condition for us of the ulterior or simultaneous conception of
external, impersonal causes."<a id="footnotetag250" name="footnotetag250"></a>

<p>Thus much for the origin of the idea of cause. We have
the same direct intuitive knowledge of cause that we have of
effect; but we have not yet rendered a full and adequate account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="206">206</a></span>
of the <i>principle of causality</i>. We have simply attained
the notion of our personal causality, and we can not arbitrarily
substitute our personal causality for all the causes of the universe,
and erect our own experience as a law of the entire universe.
We have, however, already seen (Chap. V.) that the
belief in exterior causation is <i>necessary</i> and <i>universal</i>. When a
change takes place, when a new phenomenon presents itself to
our senses, we can not avoid the conviction that it must have a
cause. We can not even express in language the relations of
phenomena in time and space, without speaking of causes. And
there is not a rational being on the face of the globe--a child,
a savage, or a philosopher--who does not instinctively and
spontaneously affirm that every movement, every change, every
new existence, <i>must</i> have a cause. Now what account can
philosophy render of this universal belief? One answer, and
only one, is possible. The <i>reason</i> of man (that power of which
Comte takes no account) is in fixed and changeless relation to
the principle of causation, just as <i>sense</i> is in fixed and changeless
relation to exterior phenomena, so that we can not know
the external world, can not think or speak of phenomenal existence,
except as <i>effects</i>. In the expressive and forcible language
of Jas. Martineau: "By an irresistible law of thought <i>all
phenomena present themselves to us as the expression of power</i>, and
refer us to a causal ground whence they issue. This dynamic
source we neither see, nor hear, nor feel; it is given in <i>thought</i>,
supplied by the spontaneous activity of mind as the correlative
prefix to the phenomena observed."<a id="footnotetag251" name="footnotetag251"></a>
<a href="#footnote251"><sup class="sml">251</sup></a> Unless, then, we are prepared
to deny the validity of all our rational intuitions, we can
not avoid accepting "this subjective postulate as a valid law
for objective nature." If the intuitions of our reason are pronounced
deceptive and mendacious, so also must the intuitions
of the senses be pronounced illusory and false. Our whole intellectual
constitution is built up on false and erroneous principles,
and all knowledge of whatever kind must perish by "the
contagion of uncertainty."</p>

<p>Comte, however, is determined to treat the idea of causation
as an illusion, whether under its psychological form, as <i>will</i>,
or under its scientific form, as <i>force</i>. He feels that Theology
is inevitable if we permit the inquiry into causes;<a id="footnotetag252" name="footnotetag252"></a>
<a href="#footnote252"><sup class="sml">252</sup></a> and he is
more anxious that theology should perish than that truth should
prevail. The human will must, therefore, be robbed of all semblance
of freedom, lest it should suggest the idea of a Supreme
Will governing nature; and human action, like all other phenomena,
must be reduced to uniform and necessary law. All
feelings, ideas, and principles guaranteed to us by consciousness
are to be cast out of the account. Psychology, resting on
self-observation, is pronounced a delusion. The immediate
consciousness of freedom is a dream. Such a procedure, to
say the least of it, is highly unphilosophical; to say the truth
about it, it is obviously dishonest. Every fact of human nature,
just as much as every fact of physical nature, must be accepted
in all its integrity, or all must be alike rejected. The
phenomena of mind can no more be disregarded than the phenomena
of matter. Rational intuitions, necessary and universal
beliefs, can no more be ignored than the uniform facts of
sense-perception, without rendering a system of knowledge
necessarily incomplete, and a system of truth utterly impossible.
Every one truth is connected with every other truth in
the universe. And yet Comte demands that a large class of
facts, the most immediate and direct of all our cognitions, shall
be rejected because they are not in harmony with the fundamental
assumption of the positive philosophy that all knowledge
is confined to <i>phenomena perceptible to sense</i>. Now it were
just as easy to cast the Alps into the Mediterranean as to obliterate
from the human intelligence the primary cognitions of
immediate consciousness, or to relegate the human reason from
the necessary laws of thought. Comte himself can not emancipate
his own mind from a belief in the validity of the testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="208" >208</a></span>
of consciousness. How can he know himself as distinct
from nature, as a living person, as the same being he was ten
years ago, or even yesterday, except by an appeal to consciousness?
Despite his earnestly-avowed opinions as to the inutility
and fallaciousness of all psychological inquiries, he is compelled
to admit that "the phenomena of life" are "<i>known by
immediate consciousness</i>."<a id="footnotetag253" name="footnotetag253"></a>
<a href="#footnote253"><sup class="sml">253</sup></a> Now the knowledge of our personal
freedom rests on precisely the same grounds as the knowledge
of our personal existence. The same "immediate consciousness"
which attests that I exist, attests also, with equal distinctness
and directness, that I am self-determined and free.</p>

<p>In common with most atheistical writers, Comte is involved
in the fatal contradiction of at one time assuming, and at another
of denying the freedom of the will, to serve the exigencies
of his theory. To prove that the order of the universe can not
be the product of a Supreme Intelligence, he assumes that the
products of mind must be characterized by freedom and variety--the
phenomena of mind must not be subject to uniform and
necessary laws; and inasmuch as the phenomena presented
by external nature are subject to uniform and changeless laws,
they can not be the product of mind. "Look at the whole
frame of things," says he; "how can it be the product of mind--of
a supernatural Will? Is it not subject to regular laws,
and do we not actually obtain <i>prevision</i> of its phenomena? If
it were the product of mind, its order would be variable and
free." Here, then, it is admitted that <i>freedom is an essential
characteristic of mind</i>. And this admission is no doubt a thoughtless,
unconscious betrayal of the innate belief of all minds in
the freedom of the will. But when Comte comes to deal with
this freedom as an objective question of philosophy, when he
directs his attention to the only will of which we have a direct
and immediate knowledge, he denies freedom and variety, and
asserts in the most arbitrary manner that the movements of the
mind, like all the phenomena of nature, must be subject to
uniform, changeless, and necessary laws. And if we have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="209">209</a></span>
yet been able to reduce the movements of mind, like the movements
of the planets, to statistics, and have not already obtained
accurate prevision of its successions or sequences as we
have of physical phenomena, it is simply the consequence of our
inattention to, or ignorance of, all the facts. We answer, there
are no facts so directly and intuitively known as the facts of
consciousness; and, therefore, an argument based upon our
supposed ignorance of these facts is not likely to have much
weight against our immediate consciousness of personal freedom.
There is not any thing we know so immediately, so certainly,
so positively, as this fact--<i>we are free</i>.</p>

<p>The word "force," representing as it does a subtile menial
conception, and not a phenomenon of sense, must also be banished
from the domains of Positive Science as an intruder, lest
its presence should lend any countenance to the idea of causation.
"Forces in mechanics are only <i>movements</i>, produced, or
tending to be produced." In order to "cancel altogether the
old metaphysical notion of force," another form of expression
is demanded. It is claimed that all we do know or can possibly
know is the successions of phenomena in time. What,
then, is the term which henceforth, in our dynamics, shall take
the place of "force?" Is it "Time-succession?" Then let any
one attempt to express the various forms and intensities of
movement and change presented to the senses (as <i>e.g.</i>, the
phenomena of heat, electricity, galvanism, magnetism, muscular
and nervous action, etc.) in terms of Time-succession, and
he will at once become conscious of the utter hopelessness
of physics, without the hyperphysical idea of force, to render
itself intelligible.<a id="footnotetag254" name="footnotetag254"></a>
<a href="#footnote254"><sup class="sml">254</sup></a> What account can be rendered of planetary
motion if the terms "centrifugal force" and "centripetal force"
are abandoned? "From the two great conditions of every
Newtonian solution, viz., projectile impulse and centripetal tendency,
eject the idea of <i>force</i>, and what remains? The entire
conception is simply made up of this, and has not the faintest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="210" >210</a></span>
existence without it. It is useless to give it notice to quit, and
pretend that it is gone when you have only put a new name
upon the door. We must not call it 'attraction,' lest there
should seem to be a <i>power</i> within; we are to speak of it only
as 'gravitation,' because that is only 'weight,' which is nothing
but a 'fact,' as if it were not a fact that holds a power, a
true dynamic affair, which no imagination can chop into incoherent
successions.<a id="footnotetag255" name="footnotetag255"></a>
<a href="#footnote255"><sup class="sml">255</sup></a> Nor is the evasion more successful when
we try the phrase, 'tendency of bodies to mutual approach.'
The approach itself may be called a phenomenon; but the
'tendency' is no phenomenon, and can not be attributed by
us to the bodies without regarding them as the residence of
force. And what are we to say of the <i>projectile impulse</i> in the
case of the planets? Is that also a phenomenon? Who witnessed
and reported it? Is it not evident that the whole
scheme of physical astronomy is a resolution of observed facts
into dynamic equivalents, and that the hypothesis posits for its
calculations not phenomena, but proper forces? Its logic is
this: <i>If</i> an impulse of certain intensity were given, and <i>if</i> such
and such mutual attractions were constantly present, then the
sort of motions which we observe in the bodies of our system
<i>would follow</i>. So, however, they also would <i>if</i> willed by an
Omnipotent Intelligence."<a id="footnotetag256" name="footnotetag256"></a>
<a href="#footnote256"><sup class="sml">256</sup></a> It is thus clearly evident that
human science is unable to offer any explanation of the existing
order of the universe except in terms expressive of Power
or Force; that, in fact, all explanations are utterly unintelligible
without the idea of causation. The language of universal
rational intuition is, "all phenomena are the expression
of power;" the language of science is, "every law implies a
force."</p>

<p>It is furthermore worthy of being noted that, in the modern
doctrine of the Correlation and Conservation of Forces, science
is inevitably approaching the idea that all kinds of force are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="211">211</a></span>
but forms or manifestations of some <i>one</i> central force issuing
from some <i>one</i> fountain-head of power. Dr. Carpenter, perhaps
the greatest living physiologist, teaches that "the form of force
<i>which may be taken as the type of all the rest</i>" is the consciousness
of living effort in volition.<a id="footnotetag257" name="footnotetag257"></a>
<a href="#footnote257"><sup class="sml">257</sup></a> All force, then, is of one type,

<p>2. <i>As to Final Causes</i>--that is, reasons, purposes, or ends
<i>for</i> which things exist--these, we are told by Comte, are all
"disproved" by Positive Science, which rigidly limits us to
"the history of <i>what is</i>," and forbids all inquiry into reasons
<i>why it is</i>. The question whether there be any intelligent purpose
in the order and arrangement of the universe, is not a
subject of scientific inquiry at all; and whenever it has been
permitted to obtrude itself, it has thrown a false light over the
facts, and led the inquirer astray.</p>

<p>The discoveries of modern astronomy are specially instanced
by Comte as completely overthrowing the notion of
any conscious design or intelligent purpose in the universe.
The order and stability of the solar system are found to be the
<i>necessary</i> consequences of gravitation, and are adequately explained
without any reference to purposes or ends to be fulfilled
in the disposition and arrangement of the heavenly
bodies. "With persons unused to the study of the celestial
bodies, though very likely informed on other parts of natural
philosophy, astronomy has still the reputation of being a science
eminently religious, as if the famous words, 'The heavens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="212" >212</a></span>
declare the glory of God, had lost none of their truth... No
science has given more terrible shocks to the doctrine of <i>final
causes</i> than astronomy.<a id="footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a>
<a href="#footnote259"><sup class="sml">259</sup></a> The simple knowledge of the movement
of the earth must have destroyed the original and real
foundation of this doctrine--the idea of the universe subordinated
to the earth, and consequently to man. Besides, the accurate
exploration of the solar system could not fail to dispel
that blind and unlimited admiration which the general order of
nature inspires, by showing in the most sensible manner, and
in a great number of different respects, that the orbs were certainly
not disposed in the most advantageous manner, and that
science permits us easily to conceive a better arrangement, by
the development of true celestial mechanism, since Newton.
All the theological philosophy, even the most perfect, has been
henceforth deprived of its principal intellectual function, the
most regular order being thus consigned as necessarily established
and maintained in our world, and even in the whole
universe, <i>by the simple mutual gravity of its several parts</i>."<a id="footnotetag260" name="footnotetag260"></a>

<p>The task of "conceiving a better arrangement" of the celestial
orbs, and improving the system of the universe generally,
we shall leave to those who imagine themselves possessed of
that omniscience which comprehends all the facts and relations
of the actual universe, and foreknows all the details and relations
of all possible universes so accurately as to be able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="213">213</a></span>
pronounce upon their relative "advantages." The arrogance
of these critics is certainly in startling and ludicrous contrast
with the affected modesty which, on other occasions, restrains
them from "imputing any intentions to nature." It is quite
enough for our purpose to know that the tracing of evidences
of <i>design</i> in those parts of nature accessible to our observation
is an essentially different thing from the construction of a
scheme of <i>optimism</i> on <i>à priori</i> grounds which shall embrace
a universe the larger portion of which is virtually beyond the
field of observation. We are conscious of possessing some rational
data and some mental equipment for the former task,
but for the latter we feel utterly incompetent.<a id="footnotetag261" name="footnotetag261"></a>

<p>The only plausible argument in the above quotation from
Comte is, that the whole phenomena of the solar system are
adequately explained by the law of gravitation, without the intervention
of any intelligent purpose. Let it be borne in mind
that it is a fundamental principle of the Positive philosophy
that all human knowledge is necessarily confined to phenomena
<i>perceptible to sense</i>, and that the fast and highest achievement
of human science is to observe and record "the invariable
relations of resemblance and succession among phenomena."
We can not possibly know any thing of even the existence of
"causes" or "forces" lying back of phenomena, nor of "reasons"
or "purposes" determining the relations of phenomena.
The "law of gravitation" must, therefore, be simply the statement
of a fact, the expression of an observed order of phenomena.
But the simple statement of a fact is no <i>explanation</i> of
the fact. The formal expression of an observed order of succession
among phenomena is no <i>explanation</i> of that order.
For what do we mean by an explanation? Is it not a "making
plain" to the understanding? It is, in short, a complete answer
to the questions <i>how</i> is it so? and <i>why</i> is it so? Now, if
Comte denies to himself and to us all knowledge of efficient
and final causation, if we are in utter ignorance of "forces"
operating in nature, and of "reasons" for which things exist in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="214" >214</a></span>
nature, he can not answer either question, and consequently
nothing is explained.</p>

<p>Practically, however, Comte regards gravitation as a force.
The order of the solar system has been established and is still
maintained by the mutual gravity of its several parts. We
shall not stop here to note the inconsistency of his denying to
us the knowledge of, even the existence of, force, and yet at the
same time assuming to treat gravitation as a force really adequate
to the explanation of the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> of the phenomena
of the universe, without any reference to a supernatural will or
an intelligent mind. The question with which we are immediately
concerned is whether gravitation <i>alone</i> is adequate to
the explanation of the phenomena of the heavens? A review
<i>in extenso</i> of Comte's answer to this question would lead us into
all the inextricable mazes of the nebular hypothesis, and involve
us in a more extended discussion than our space permits
and our limited scientific knowledge justifies. For the masses
of the people the whole question of cosmical development resolves
itself into "a balancing of authorities;" they are not in
a position to verify the reasonings for and against this theory
by actual observation of astral phenomena, and the application
of mathematical calculus; they are, therefore, guided by balancing
in their own minds the statements of the distinguished
astronomers who, by the united suffrages of the scientific
world, are regarded as "authorities." For us, at present, it is
enough that the nebular hypothesis is rejected by some of the
greatest astronomers that have lived. We need only mention
the names of Sir William Herschel, Sir John Herschel, Prof.
Nichol, Earl Rosse, Sir David Brewster, and Prof. Whewell.</p>

<p>But if we grant that the nebular hypothesis is entitled to
take rank as an established theory of the development of the
solar system, it by no means proves that the solar system was
formed without the intervention of intelligence and design. On
this point we shall content ourselves with quoting the words of
one whose encyclopædian knowledge was confessedly equal to
that of Comte, and who in candor and accuracy was certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="215" >215</a></span>
his superior. Prof. Whewell, in his "Astronomy and Physics,"
says: "This hypothesis by no means proves that the solar system
was formed without the intervention of intelligence and
design. It only transfers our view of the skill exercised and
the means employed to another part of the work; for how
came the sun and its atmosphere to have such materials, such
motions, such a constitution, and these consequences followed
from their primordial condition? How came the parent vapor
thus to be capable of coherence, separation, contraction, solidification?
How came the laws of its motion, attraction, repulsion,
condensation, to be so fixed as to lead to a beautiful and
harmonious system in the end? How came it to be neither
too fluid nor too tenacious, to contract neither too quickly nor
too slowly for the successive formation of the several planetary
bodies? How came that substance, which at one time was a
luminous vapor, to be at a subsequent period solids and fluids
of many various kinds? What but design and intelligence prepared
and tempered this previously-existing element, so that it
should, by its natural changes, produce such an orderly system"?<a id="footnotetag262" name="footnotetag262"></a>
<a href="#footnote262"><sup class="sml">262</sup></a>
"<i>The laws of motion alone will not produce the regularity
which we admire in the motion of the heavenly bodies</i>.
There must be an original adjustment of the system on which
these laws are to act; a selection of the arbitrary quantities
which they are to involve; a primitive cause which shall dispose
the elements in due relation to each other, in order that
regular recurrence may accompany constant change, and that
perpetual motion may be combined with perpetual stability."<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a>

<p>The harmony of the solar system in all its phenomena does
not depend upon the operation of any <i>one</i> law, but from the
special adjustment of several laws. There are certain agents
operating throughout the entire system which have different
properties, and which require special adjustment to each other,
in order to their beneficial operation. 1st. There is <i>Gravitation,</i>
prevailing apparently through all space. But it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="216" >216</a></span>
prevail alone. It is a force whose function is to balance other
forces of which we know little, except that these, again, are
needed to balance the force of gravitation. Each force, if left
to itself, would be the destruction of the universe. Were it not
for the force of gravitation, the centrifugal forces which impel
the planets would fling them off into space. Were it not for
these centrifugal forces, the force of gravitation would dash
them against the sun. The ultimate fact of astronomical science,
therefore, is not the law of gravitation, but the <i>adjustment</i>
between this law and other laws, so as to produce and maintain
the existing order.<a id="footnotetag264" name="footnotetag264"></a>
<a href="#footnote264"><sup class="sml">264</sup></a> 2d. There is <i>Light</i>, flowing from numberless
luminaries; and <i>Heat</i>, radiating everywhere from the
warmer to the colder regions; and there are a number of adjustments
needed in order to the beneficial operation of these
agents. Suppose we grant that by merely mechanical causes
the sun became the centre of our system, how did it become
also the <i>source of its vivifying influences</i>? "How was the fire
deposited on this hearth? How was the candle placed on this
candlestick?" 3d. There is an all-pervading <i>Ether</i>, through
which light is transmitted, which offers resistance to the movement
of the planetary and cometary bodies, and tends to a dissipation
of mechanical energy, and which needs to be counter-balanced
by well-adjusted arrangements to secure the stability
of the solar system. All this balancing of opposite properties
and forces carries our minds upward towards Him who holds
the balances in his hands, and to a Supreme Intelligence on
whose adjustments and collocations the harmony and stability
of the universe depends.<a id="footnotetag265" name="footnotetag265"></a>

<p>The recognition of all teleology of organs in vegetable and
animal physiology is also persistently repudiated by this school.
When Cuvier speaks of the combination of organs in such
order as to adapt the animal to the part which it has to play in
nature, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire replies, "I know nothing of animals
which have to play a part in nature." "I have read,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="217" >217</a></span>
concerning fishes, that, because they live in a medium which resists
more than air, their motive forces are calculated so as to
give them the power of progression under these circumstances.
By this mode of reasoning, you would say of a man who makes
use of crutches, that he was originally destined to the misfortune
of having a leg paralyzed or amputated.<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a>
<a href="#footnote266"><sup class="sml">266</sup></a> "With a modesty
which savors of affectation, he says, "I ascribe no intentions
to God, for I mistrust the feeble powers of my reason. I
observe facts merely, and go no farther. I only pretend to the
character of the historian of <i>what is</i>." "I can not make Nature
an intelligent being who does nothing in vain, who acts by the
shortest mode, who does all for the best."<a id="footnotetag267" name="footnotetag267"></a>
<a href="#footnote267"><sup class="sml">267</sup></a> All the supposed
consorting of means to ends which has hitherto been regarded
as evidencing Intelligence is simply the result of "the elective
affinities of organic elements" and "the differentiation of organs"
consequent mainly upon exterior conditions. "<i>Functions
are a result, not an end</i>. The animal undergoes the kind
of life that his organs impose, and submits to the imperfections
of his organization. The naturalist studies the play of his apparatus,
and if he has the right of admiring most of its parts,
he has likewise that of showing the imperfection of other parts,
and the practical uselessness of those which fulfill no functions."<a id="footnotetag268" name="footnotetag268"></a>
<a href="#footnote268"><sup class="sml">268</sup></a>
And it is further claimed that there are a great many
structures which are clearly useless; that is, they fulfill no purpose
at all. Thus there are monkeys, which have no thumbs
for use, but only rudimental thumb-bones hid beneath the
skin; the wingless bird of New Zealand (Apteryx) has wing-bones
similarly developed, which serve no purpose; young
whalebone whales are born with teeth that never cut the gums,
and are afterwards absorbed; and some sheep have horns
turned about their ears which fulfill no end. And inasmuch as
there are some organisms in nature which serve no purpose of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="218">218</a></span>
utility, it is argued there is no design in nature; things are <i>used</i>
because there are antecedent conditions favorable for <i>use</i>, but
that use is not the <i>end</i> for which the organ exists. The true
naturalist will never say, "Birds have wings given them <i>in order</i>
to fly;" he will rather say, "Birds fly <i>because</i> they have wings."
The doctrine of final causes must, therefore, be abandoned.</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to reply to the lame argument of
Geoffroy, which needs a "crutch" for its support. The very
illustration, undignified and irrelevant as it is, tells altogether
against its author. For, first, the crutch is certainly a <i>contrivance</i>
designed for locomotion; secondly, the length and
strength and lightness of the crutch are all matters of calculation
and <i>adjustment</i>; and, thirdly, all the adaptations of the
crutch are well-considered, in order to enable the lame man to
walk; the function of the crutch is the final cause of its creation.
This crutch is clearly out of place in Geoffroy's argument,
and utterly breaks down. It is in its place in the teleological
argument, and stands well, though it may not behave as
well as the living limb. The understanding of a child can perceive
that the design-argument does not assert that men were
intended to have amputated limbs, but that crutches are designed
for those whose limbs are paralyzed or amputated.</p>

<p>The existence of useless members, of rudimentary and abortive
limbs, does seem, at first sight, to be unfavorable to the
idea of supremacy of purpose and all-pervading design. It
should be remarked, however, that this is an argument based
upon our ignorance, and not upon our knowledge. It does
not by any means follow that because we have discovered no
reasons for their existence, therefore there are no reasons.
Science, in enlarging its conquests of nature, is perpetually discovering
the usefulness of arrangements of which our fathers
were ignorant, and the reasons of things which to their minds,
were concealed; and it ill becomes the men who so far "mistrust
their own feeble powers" as to be afraid of ascribing any
intention to God or nature, to dogmatically affirm there is no
purpose in the existence of any thing. And then we may ask,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="219">219</a></span>
what right have these men to set up the idea of "utility" as the
only standard to which the Creator must conform? How came
they to know that God is a mere "utilitarian;" or, if they do
not believe in God, that nature is a miserable "Benthamite?"
Why may not the idea of beauty, of symmetry, of order, be a
standard for the universe, as much as the idea of utility, or mere
subordination to some practical end? May not conformity to
one grand and comprehensive plan, sweeping over all nature,
be perfectly compatible with the adaptation of individual existences
to the fulfillment of special ends? In civil architecture
we have conformity to a general plan; we have embellishment
and ornament, and we have adaptation to a special purpose,
all combined; why may not these all be combined in the architecture
of the universe? The presence of any one of these is
sufficient to prove design, for mere ornament or beauty is itself
a purpose, an object, and an end. The concurrence of all
these is an overwhelming evidence of design. Wherever
found, they are universally recognized as the product of intelligence;
they address themselves at once to the intelligence of
man, and they place him in immediate relation to and in deepest
sympathy with the Intelligence which gave them birth. He
that formed the eye of man to see, and the heart of man to
admire beauty, shall He not delight in it? He that gave the
hand of man its cunning to create beauty, shall He not himself
work for it? And if man can and does combine both "ornament"
and "use" in one and the same implement or machine,
why should not the Creator of the world do the same? "When
the savage carves the handle of his war-club, the immediate
purpose of his carving is to give his own hand a firmer hold.
But any shapeless scratches would be enough for this. When
he carves it in an elaborate pattern, he does so for the love of
ornament, and to satisfy the sense of beauty." And so "the
harmonies, on which all beauty depends, are so connected in
nature that <i>use</i> and <i>ornament</i> may often both arise out of the
same conditions."<a id="footnotetag269" name="footnotetag269"></a>

<p>The "true naturalist," therefore, recognizes two great principles
pervading the universe--<i>a principle of order</i>--a unity
of plan, and <i>a principle of special adaptation</i>, by which each
object, though constructed upon a general plan, is at the same
time accommodated to the place it has to occupy and the purpose
it has to serve. In other words, there is <i>homology of
structure</i> and <i>analogy of function</i>, conformity to <i>archetypal forms</i>
and <i>Teleology of organs</i>, in wonderful combination. Now, in
the Materialistic school, it has been the prevalent practice to
set up the unity of plan in animal structures, in opposition to
the principle of Final Causes: Morphology has been opposed
to Teleology. But in nature there is no such opposition; on
the contrary, there is a beautiful co-ordination. The same
bones, in different animals, are made subservient to the widest
possible diversity of functions. The same limbs are converted
into fins, paddles, wings, legs, and arms. "No comparative
anatomist has the slightest hesitation in admitting that the
pectoral fin of a fish, the wing of a bird, the paddle of the dolphin,
the fore-leg of a deer, the wing of a bat, and the arm of a
man, are the same organs, notwithstanding that their forms are
so varied, and the uses to which they are applied so unlike
each other."<a id="footnotetag270" name="footnotetag270"></a>
<a href="#footnote270"><sup class="sml">270</sup></a> All these are homologous in structure--they are
formed after an ideal archetype or model, but that model or
type is variously modified to adapt the animal to the sphere of
life in which it is destined to move, and the organ itself to the
functions it has to perform, whether swimming, flying, walking,
or burrowing, or that varied manipulation of which the human
hand is capable. These varied modifications of the vertebrated
type, for special purposes, are unmistakable examples of final
causation. Whilst the silent members, the rudimental limbs
instanced by Oken, Martins, and others--as fulfilling no purpose,
and serving no end, exist in conformity to an ideal archetype
on which the bony skeletons of all vertebrated animals
are formed,<a id="footnotetag271" name="footnotetag271"></a>
<a href="#footnote271"><sup class="sml">271</sup></a> and which has never been departed from since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="221" >221</a></span>
time began. This type, or model, or plan, is, however, itself
an evidence of <i>design</i> as much as the plan of a house. For to
what standard are we referring when we say that two limbs
are morphologically the same? Is it not an <i>ideal</i> plan, a <i>mental</i>
pattern, a metaphysical conception? Now an <i>ideal</i> implies
a mind which preconceived the idea, and in which alone it
really exists. It is only as "an <i>order of Divine thought</i>" that
the doctrine of animal homologies is at all intelligible; and
Homology is, therefore, the science which traces the outward
embodiment of a Divine Idea.<a id="footnotetag272" name="footnotetag272"></a>
<a href="#footnote272"><sup class="sml">272</sup></a> The principle of intentionality
or final causation, then, is not in any sense invalidated by the
discovery of "a unity of plan" sweeping through the entire
universe.</p>

<p>We conclude that we are justly entitled to regard "the
principle of intentionality" as a primary and necessary law of
thought, under which we can not avoid conceiving and describing
the facts of the universe--<i>the special adaptation of means to
ends necessarily implies mind</i>. Whenever and wherever we observe
the adaptation of an organism to the fulfillment of a special
end, we can not avoid conceiving of that <i>end</i> as foreseen and
premeditated, the <i>means</i> as selected and adjusted with a view
to that end, and creative energy put forth to secure the end--all
which is the work of intelligence and will.<a id="footnotetag273" name="footnotetag273"></a>
<a href="#footnote273"><sup class="sml">273</sup></a> And we can
not describe these facts of nature, so as to render that account
intelligible to other minds, without using such terms as "contrivance,"
"purpose," "adaptation," "design." A striking illustration
of this may be found in Darwin's volume "On the
Fertilization of Orchids." We select from his volume with all
the more pleasure because he is one of the writers who enjoins
"caution in ascribing intentions to nature." In one sentence
he says: "The <i>Labellum</i> is developed into a long nectary, <i>in
order</i> to attract <i>Lepidoptera</i>; and we shall presently give reasons
for suspecting the nectar is <i>purposely</i> so lodged that it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="222">222</a></span>
be sucked only slowly, <i>in order</i> to give time for the curious
chemical quality of the viscid matter settling hard and dry"
(p. 29). Of one particular structure he says: "This <i>contrivance</i>
of the guiding ridges may be compared to the little instrument
sometimes used for guiding a thread into the eye of a
needle." The notion that every organism has a use or purpose
seems to have guided him in his discoveries. "The
strange position of the <i>Labellum</i>, perched on the summit of the
column, ought to have shown me that here was the place for
experiment. I ought to have scorned the notion that the <i>Labellum</i>
was thus placed <i>for no good purpose</i>. I neglected this
plain guide, and for a long time completely failed to understand
the flower" (p. 262).<a id="footnotetag274" name="footnotetag274"></a>

<p>So that the assumption of final causes has not, as Bacon
affirms, "led men astray" and "prejudiced further discovery;"
on the contrary, it has had a large share in every discovery in
anatomy and physiology, zoology and botany. The use of
every organ has been discovered by starting from the assumption
<i>that it must have some use</i>. The belief in a creative purpose
led Harvey to discover the circulation of the blood. He
says: "When I took notice that the valves in the veins of so
many parts of the body were so placed that they gave a free
passage to the blood towards the heart, but opposed the passage
of the venal blood the contrary way, I was incited to imagine
that so provident a cause as Nature has not placed so
many valves <i>without design</i>, and no design seemed more probable
than the circulation of the blood."<a id="footnotetag275" name="footnotetag275"></a>
<a href="#footnote275"><sup class="sml">275</sup></a> The wonderful discoveries
in Zoology which have immortalized the name of Cuvier
were made under the guidance of this principle. He proceeds
on the supposition not only that animal forms have <i>some</i> plan,
<i>some</i> purpose, but that they have an intelligible plan, a discoverable
purpose. At the outset of his "<i>Règne Animal</i>" he says:
"Zoology has a principle of reasoning which is peculiar to it,
and which it employs to advantage on many occasions; that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="223">223</a></span>
the principle of the conditions of existence, commonly called
final causes."<a id="footnotetag276" name="footnotetag276"></a>
<a href="#footnote276"><sup class="sml">276</sup></a> The application of this principle enabled him
to understand and arrange the structures of animals with astonishing
clearness and completeness of order; and to restore
the forms of extinct animals which are found in the rocks, in a
manner which excited universal admiration, and has commanded
universal assent. Indeed, as Professor Whewell remarks,
at the conclusion of his "History of the Inductive Sciences,"
"those who have been discoverers in science have generally
had minds, the disposition of which was to believe in an <i>intelligent
Maker</i> of the universe, and that the scientific speculations
which produced an opposite tendency were generally those
which, though they might deal familiarly with known physical
truths, and conjecture boldly with regard to unknown, do not
add to the number of solid generalizations."<a id="footnotetag277" name="footnotetag277"></a>

<p>1. <i>As to Events and Causes</i>.--"Events do not occur isolated,
apart, by themselves; they occur and are conceived by us only
in connection. Our observation affords us no example of a
phenomenon which is not an effect; nay, our thought can not
even realize to itself the possibility of a phenomenon without a
cause. By the necessity we are under of thinking some cause
for every phenomenon, and by our original ignorance of what
particular causes belong to what particular effects, it is rendered
impossible for us to acquiesce in the mere knowledge
of the fact of the phenomenon; on the contrary, we are determined,
we are necessitated to regard each phenomenon as <i>only
partially known until we discover the causes</i> on which it depends
for its existence.<a id="footnotetag280" name="footnotetag280"></a>
<a href="#footnote280"><sup class="sml">280</sup></a> Philosophic knowledge is thus, in its widest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="225">225</a></span>
acceptation, the knowledge of effects as dependent on causes.
Now what does this imply? In the first place, as every cause
to which we can ascend is only an effect, it follows that it is
the scope, that is, the aim, of philosophy to trace up the series
of effects and causes until we arrive at <i>causes which are not in
themselves effects</i>,"<a id="footnotetag281" name="footnotetag281"></a>
<a href="#footnote281"><sup class="sml">281</sup></a>--that is, to ultimate and final causes. And
then, finally, "Philosophy, as the knowledge of effects in their
causes, necessarily tends, not towards a plurality of ultimate or
final causes, but towards <i>one</i> alone."<a id="footnotetag282" name="footnotetag282"></a>

<p>2. <i>As to Qualities and Substance, or Phenomena and Reality</i>.--As
phenomena appear only in conjunction, we are compelled,
by the constitution of our nature, to think them conjoined in
and by something; and as they are phenomena, we can not
think them phenomena of nothing, but must regard them as
properties or qualities of something.<a id="footnotetag283" name="footnotetag283"></a>
<a href="#footnote283"><sup class="sml">283</sup></a> Now that which manifests
its qualities--in other words, that in which the appearing
causes inhere, that to which they belong--is called their <i>subject</i>,
or <i>substance</i>, or <i>substratum</i>.<a id="footnotetag284" name="footnotetag284"></a>
<a href="#footnote284"><sup class="sml">284</sup></a> The subject of one grand series
of phenomena (as, <i>e.g.</i>, extension, solidity, figure, etc.) is called
<i>matter</i>, or <i>material substance</i>. The subject of the other grand
series of phenomena (as, <i>e.g.</i>, thought, feeling, volition, etc.) is
termed <i>mind</i>, or <i>mental substance</i>. We may, therefore, lay it
down as an undisputed truth that consciousness gives, as an
ultimate fact, a primitive duality--a knowledge of the <i>ego</i> in relation
and contrast to the <i>non-ego</i>, and a knowledge of the <i>non-ego</i>
in relation and contrast to the <i>ego</i><a id="footnotetag285" name="footnotetag285"></a>

establishes the existence of two worlds of <i>mind</i> and <i>matter</i> on
the immediate knowledge we possess of both series of phenomena;
whilst the Cosmothetic Idealists discredit the veracity
of consciousness as to our immediate knowledge of material
phenomena, and, consequently, our <i>immediate knowledge of the

<p>The obvious doctrine of the above quotations is, that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="226" >226</a></span>
have an immediate knowledge of the "<i>existence</i> of matter" as
well as of "the <i>phenomena</i> of matter;" that is, we know "<i>substance</i>"
as immediately and directly as we know "<i>qualities</i>."
Phenomena are known only as inherent in substance; substance
is known only as manifesting its qualities. We never
know qualities without knowing substance, and we can never
know substance without knowing qualities. Both are known
in one concrete act; substance is known quite as much as
quality; quality is known no more than substance. That we
have a direct, immediate, presentative "face to face" knowledge
of matter and mind in every act of consciousness is asserted
again and again by Hamilton, in his "Philosophy of
Perception."<a id="footnotetag287" name="footnotetag287"></a>
<a href="#footnote287"><sup class="sml">287</sup></a> In the course of the discussion he starts the
question, "<i>Is the knowledge of mind and matter equally immediate?</i>"
His answer to this question may be condensed in the
following sentences. In regard to the immediate knowledge
of <i>mind</i> there is no difficulty; it is admitted to be direct and
immediate. The problem, therefore, exclusively regards the
intuitive perception of the qualities of <i>matter</i>. Now, says Hamilton,
"if we interrogate consciousness concerning the point in
question, the response is categorical and clear. In the simplest
act of perception I am conscious of <i>myself</i> as a perceiving
<i>subject</i>, and of an external <i>reality</i> as the object perceived;
and I am conscious of both existences in the same indivisible
amount of intuition."<a id="footnotetag288" name="footnotetag288"></a>
<a href="#footnote288"><sup class="sml">288</sup></a> Again he says, "I have frequently asserted
that in perception we are conscious of the external object,
immediately and <i>in itself</i>." "If, then, the veracity of consciousness
be unconditionally admitted--<i>if the intuitive knowledge
of matter and mind</i>, and the consequent reality of their antithesis,
be taken as truths," the doctrine of Natural Realism is
established, and, "without any hypothesis or demonstration,
the <i>reality of mind</i> and the <i>reality of matter</i>."<a id="footnotetag289" name="footnotetag289"></a>

<p>Now, after these explicit statements that we have an intuitive
knowledge of matter and mind--a direct and immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="227">227</a></span>
consciousness of self as a real, "self-subsisting entity," and a
knowledge of "an external reality, immediately and <i>in itself</i>,"
it seems unaccountably strange that Hamilton should assert
"<i>that all human knowledge, consequently all human philosophy, is
only of the Relative or Phenomenal</i>;"<a id="footnotetag290" name="footnotetag290"></a>
<a href="#footnote290"><sup class="sml">290</sup></a> and that "<i>of existence absolutely
and in itself we know nothing</i>."<a id="footnotetag291" name="footnotetag291"></a>
<a href="#footnote291"><sup class="sml">291</sup></a> Whilst teaching that the
proper sphere and aim of philosophy is to trace secondary
causes up to ultimate or first causes, and that it <i>necessarily tends</i>
towards one First and Ultimate Cause, he at the same time asserts
that "first causes do not lie within the reach of philosophy,"<a id="footnotetag292" name="footnotetag292x"></a>
<a href="#footnote292"><sup class="sml">292</sup></a>
and that it can never attain to the knowledge of the
First Cause.<a id="footnotetag293" name="footnotetag293"></a>
<a href="#footnote293"><sup class="sml">293</sup></a> "The Infinite God can not, by us, be comprehended,

<a href="#footnote294"><sup class="sml">294</sup></a> God, as First Cause, as infinite,
as unconditioned, as eternal, is to us absolutely "<i>The
Unknown</i>." The science of Real Being--of Being <i>in se</i>--of
self-subsisting entities, is declared to be impossible. All science
is only of the phenomenal, the conditioned, the relative.
Ontology is a delusive dream. Thus, after pages of explanations
and qualifications, of affirmations and denials, we find
Hamilton virtually assuming the same position as Comte and
Mill--<i>all human knowledge is necessarily confined to phenomena</i>.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the chief glory of Sir William
Hamilton rested upon his able exposition and defense of the
doctrine of Natural Realism. There are, however, indications
in his writings that he regarded "the Philosophy of the Conditioned"
as his grand achievement. The Law of the Conditioned
had "not been generalized by any previous philosopher;"
and, in laying down that law, he felt that he had made
a new and important contribution to speculative thought.</p>

<p>The principles upon which this philosophy is based are:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Relativity of all Human Knowledge.</i>--Existence is not
cognized absolutely and in itself, but only under special modes
which are related to our faculties, and, in fact, determined by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="228" >228</a></span>
these faculties themselves. All knowledge, therefore, is <i>relative</i>--that
is, it is of phenomena only, and of phenomena "under
modifications determined by our own faculties." Now, as
the Absolute is that which exists out of all relation either to
phenomena or to our faculties of knowledge, it can not possibly
be <i>known</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Conditionality of all Thinking</i>.--Thought necessarily
supposes conditions. "To think is to condition; and conditional
limitation is the fundamental law of the possibility of
thought. As the eagle can not out-soar the atmosphere in
which he floats, and by which alone he is supported, so the
mind can not transcend the sphere of limitation within and
through which the possibility of thought is realized. Thought
is only of the conditioned, because, as we have said, to think is
to condition."<a id="footnotetag295" name="footnotetag295"></a>
<a href="#footnote295"><sup class="sml">295</sup></a> Now the Infinite is the unlimited, the unconditioned,
and as such can not possibly be <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The notion of the Infinite--the Absolute, as entertained by
man, is a mere "negation of thought.</i>"--By this Hamilton does
not mean that the idea of the Infinite is a negative idea. "The
Infinite and the Absolute are <i>only</i> the names of two counter
<i>imbecilities</i> of the human mind"<a id="footnotetag296" name="footnotetag296"></a>

<p>In attempting a brief criticism of "the Philosophy of the
Conditioned," we may commence by inquiring:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="229">229</a></span>

<p>I. <i>What is the real import and significance of the doctrine "that
all human knowledge is only of the relative or phenomenal</i>?"</p>

<p>Hamilton calls this "the great axiom" of philosophy. That
we may distinctly comprehend its meaning, and understand its
bearing on the subject under discussion, we must ascertain the
sense in which he uses the words "<i>phenomenal</i>" and "<i>relative.</i>"
The importance of an exact terminology is fully appreciated by
our author; and accordingly, in three Lectures (VIII., IX., X.),
he has given a full explication of the terms most commonly employed
in philosophic discussions. Here the word "<i>phenomenon</i>"
is set down as the necessary "<i>correlative</i>" of the word
"<i>subject</i>" or "<i>substance</i>." "These terms can not be explained
apart, for each is correlative of the other, each can be comprehended
only in and through its correlative. The term '<i>subject</i>'
is used to denote the unknown (?) basis which lies under
the various <i>phenomena</i> or properties of which we become aware,
whether in our external or internal experience."<a id="footnotetag299" name="footnotetag299"></a>
<a href="#footnote299"><sup class="sml">299</sup></a> "The term
'<i>relative</i>' is <i>opposed</i> to the term '<i>absolute</i>;' therefore, in saying
that we know only the relative, I virtually assert that we know
nothing absolutely, that is, <i>in and for itself, and without relation
to us and our faculties</i>."<a id="footnotetag300" name="footnotetag300"></a>
<a href="#footnote300"><sup class="sml">300</sup></a> Now, in the philosophy of Sir William
Hamilton, "the absolute" is defined as "that which is aloof
from relation"--"that which is out of all relation."<a id="footnotetag301" name="footnotetag301"></a>
<a href="#footnote301"><sup class="sml">301</sup></a> The <i>absolute</i>
can not, therefore, be "<i>the correlative</i>" of the conditioned--can
not stand in any relation to the phenomenal. The <i>subject,</i>
however, is the necessary correlative of the phenomenal,
and, consequently, the subject and the absolute are not identical.
Furthermore, Hamilton tells us the subject <i>may be comprehended</i>
in and through its correlative--the phenomenon; but
the absolute, being aloof from all relation, can not be comprehended
or conceived at all. "The subject" and "the absolute"
are, therefore, not synonymous terms; and, if they are
not synonymous, then their antithetical terms, "phenomenal"
and "relative," can not be synonymous.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="230">230</a></span>

<p>It is manifest, however, that Hamilton does employ these
terms as synonymous, and this we apprehend is the first false
step in his philosophy of the conditioned. "All our knowledge
is of the relative <i>or</i> phenomenal." Throughout the whole of
Lectures VIII. and IX., in which he explains the doctrine of
the relativity of human knowledge, these terms are used as precisely
analogous. Now, in opposition to this, we maintain that
the relative is not always the phenomenal. A thing may be
"in relation" and yet not be a phenomenon. "The subject or
substance" may be, and really is, on the admission of Hamilton
himself, <i>correlated</i> to the phenomenon. The ego, "the conscious
<i>subject</i>"<a id="footnotetag302" name="footnotetag302"></a>
<a href="#footnote302"><sup class="sml">302</sup></a> as a "<i>self-subsisting entity</i>" is necessarily related
to the phenomena of thought, feeling, etc.; but no one
would repudiate the idea that the conscious subject is a mere
phenomenon, or "series of phenomena," with more indignation
than Hamilton. Notwithstanding the contradictory assertion,
"that the <i>subject</i> is unknown," he still teaches, with equal positiveness,
"that in every act of perception I am conscious of
self, as a perceiving <i>subject."</i> And still more explicitly he
says: "As clearly as I am conscious of existing, so clearly am
I conscious, at every moment of my existence, that the conscious
Ego is not itself a mere modification [a phenomenon],
nor a series of modifications [phenomena], but that it is itself
different from all its modifications, and a <i>self-subsisting entity</i>."<a id="footnotetag303" name="footnotetag303"></a>
<a href="#footnote303"><sup class="sml">303</sup></a>
Again: "Thought is possible only in and through the consciousness
of Self. The Self, the I, is recognized in every act
of intelligence as the <i>subject</i> to which the act belongs. It is I
that perceive, I that imagine, I that remember, etc.; these special
modes are all only the phenomena of the I."<a id="footnotetag304" name="footnotetag304"></a>
<a href="#footnote304"><sup class="sml">304</sup></a> We are,
therefore, conscious of the <i>subject</i> in the most immediate, and
direct, and intuitive manner, and the subject of which we are
conscious can not be "<i>unknown</i>." We regret that so distinguished
a philosophy should deal in such palpable contradictions;
but it is the inevitable consequence of violating that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="231">231</a></span>
fundamental principle of philosophy on which Hamilton so frequently
and earnestly insists, viz., "that the testimony of consciousness
must be accepted in all its integrity".</p>

<p>It is thus obvious that, with proper qualifications, we may
admit <i>the relativity of human knowledge</i>, and yet at the same
time reject the doctrine of Hamilton, <i>that all human knowledge
is only of the phenomenal</i>.</p>

<p>"The relativity of human knowledge," like most other
phrases into which the word "relative" enters, is vague, and
admits of a variety of meanings. If by this phrase is meant
"that we can not know objects except as related to our faculties,
or as our faculties are related to them," we accept the
statement, but regard it as a mere truism leading to no consequences,
and hardly worth stating in words. It is simply
another way of saying that, in order to an object's being known,
it must come within the range of our intellectual vision, and
that we can only know as much as we are capable of knowing.
Or, if by this phrase is meant "that we can only know things
by and through the phenomena they present," we admit this
also, for we can no more know substances apart from their
properties, than we can know qualities apart from the substances
in which they inhere. Substances can be known only in
and through their phenomena. Take away the properties, and
the thing has no longer any existence. Eliminate extension,
form, density, etc., from matter, and what have you left? "The
thing in itself," apart from its qualities, is nothing. Or, again,
if by the relativity of knowledge is meant "that all consciousness,
all thought are relative," we accept this statement also.
To conceive, to reflect, to know, is to deal with difference and
relation; the relation of subject and object; the relation of
objects among themselves; the relation of phenomena to reality,
of becoming to being. The reason of man is unquestionably
correlated to that which is beyond phenomena; it is able
to apprehend the necessary relation between phenomena and
being, extension and space, succession and time, event and
cause, the finite and the infinite. We may thus admit the <i>relative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="232">232</a></span>
character of human thought</i>, and at the same time deny
that it is an ontological disqualification.<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a>
<a href="#footnote305"><sup class="sml">305</sup></a></p>

<p>It is not, however, in any of these precise forms that Hamilton
holds the doctrine of the relativity of knowledge. He
assumes a middle place between Reid and Kant, and endeavors
to blend the subjective idealism of the latter with the realism
of the former. "He identifies the <i>phenomenon</i> of the
German with the <i>quality</i> of the British philosophy,"<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a>
<a href="#footnote306"><sup class="sml">306</sup></a> and asserts,
as a regulative law of thought, that the quality implies
the substance, and the phenomenon the noumenon, but makes
the substratum or noumenon (the object in itself) unknown
and unknowable. The "phenomenon" of Kant was, however,
something essentially different from the "quality" of Reid.
In the philosophy of Kant, <i>phenomenon</i> means an object as we
envisage or represent it to ourselves, in opposition to the
<i>noumenon</i>, or a thing as it is in itself. The phenomenon is
composed, in part, of subjective elements supplied by the mind
itself; as regards intuition, the forms of space and time; as
regards thought, the categories of Quantity, Quality, Relation,
and Modality. To perceive a thing in itself would be to perceive
it neither in space nor in time. To think a thing in itself
would be not to think it under any of the categories. The
phenomenal is thus the product of the inherent laws of our
own constitution, and, as such, is the sum and limit of all our
knowledge.<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a>

<p>This, in its main features, is evidently the doctrine propounded
by Hamilton. The special modes in which existence
is cognizable" are presented to, and known by, the mind <i>under

<a href="#footnote308"><sup class="sml">308</sup></a> This doctrine

<p>Let us test the validity of this majestic deliverance. No
man is justified in making this assertion unless, 1. He knows
things as they exist; 2. He knows things not only as they exist
but as they appear; 3. He is able to compare things as they
exist with the same things as they appear. Now, inasmuch as
Sir William Hamilton affirms we do not know things as they
exist, but only as they appear, how can he know that there is
any difference between things as they exist and as they appear?
What is this "<i>thing in itself</i>" about which Hamilton has so
much to say, and yet about which he professes to know nothing?
We readily understand what is meant by the <i>thing</i>; it is the
object as existing--a substance manifesting certain characteristic
qualities. But what is meant by <i>in itself</i>? There can be
no <i>in itself</i> besides or beyond the <i>thing</i>. If Hamilton means
that "the thing itself" is the thing apart from all relation, and
devoid of all properties or qualities, we do not acknowledge
any such thing. A thing apart from all relation, and devoid
of all qualities, is simply pure nothing, if such a solecism may
be permitted. With such a definition of Being <i>in se</i>, the logic
of Hegel is invincible, "Being and Nothing are identical."</p>

<p>And now, if "the thing in itself" be, as Hamilton says it is,
absolutely <i>unknown</i>, how can he affirm or deny any thing in
regard to it? By what right does he prejudge a hidden reality,
and give or refuse its predicates; as, for example, that it is
conditioned or unconditioned, in relation or aloof from relation,
finite or infinite? Is it not plain that, in declaring a thing in
its inmost nature or essence to be inscrutable, it is assumed to
be partially <i>known</i>? And it is obvious, notwithstanding some
unguarded expressions to the contrary, that Hamilton does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="234" >234</a></span>
regard "the thing in itself" as partially known. "The external
reality" is, at least, six elements out of twelve in the "total object
of consciousness."<a id="footnotetag310" name="footnotetag310"></a>
<a href="#footnote310"><sup class="sml">310</sup></a> The primary qualities of matter are
known as in the things themselves; "they develop themselves
with rigid necessity out of the simple datum of <i>substance occupying
space</i>."<a id="footnotetag311" name="footnotetag311"></a>
<a href="#footnote311"><sup class="sml">311</sup></a> "The Primary Qualities are apprehended as they
are in bodies"--"they are the attributes of <i>body as body</i>," and
as such "are known immediately in themselves,"<a id="footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a>
<a href="#footnote312"><sup class="sml">312</sup></a> as well as
mediately by their effects upon us. So that we not only know
by direct consciousness certain properties of things as they exist
in things themselves, but we can also deduce them in an <i>à priori</i>
manner. "The bare notion of matter being given, the Primary
Qualities may be deduced <i>à priori</i>; they being, in fact,
only evolutions of the conditions which that notion necessarily
implies." If, then, we know the qualities of things as "in the
things themselves," "the things themselves" must also be, at
least, partially known; and Hamilton can not consistently assert
the relativity of <i>all</i> knowledge. Even if it be granted that
our cognitions of objects are only in part dependent on the
objects themselves, and in part on elements superadded by our
organism, or by our minds, it can not warrant the assertion
that all our knowledge, but only the part so added, is relative.
"The admixture of the relative element not only does not take
away the absolute character of the remainder, but does not
even (if our author is right) prevent us from recognizing it.
The confusion, according to him, is not inextricable. It is
for us 'to analyze and distinguish what elements,' in an 'act
of knowledge,' are contributed by the object, and what by the
organs or by the mind."<a id="footnotetag313" name="footnotetag313"></a>

<p>Admitting the relative character of human thought as a psychological
fact, Mr. Martineau has conclusively shown that this
law, instead of visiting us with disability to transcend phenomena,
<i>operates as a revelation of what exists beyond</i>. "The finite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="235">235</a></span>
body cut out before our visual perception, or embraced by the
hands, lies as an island in the emptiness around, and without
comparative reference to this can not be represented: the same
experience which gives us the definite object gives us also the
infinite space; and both terms--the limited appearance and
the unlimited ground--are apprehended with equal certitude
and clearness, and furnished with names equally susceptible of
distinct use in predication and reasoning. The transient successions,
for instance, the strokes of a clock, which we count,
present themselves to us as dotted out upon a line of permanent
duration; of which, without them, we should have no apprehension,
but which as their condition, is unreservedly known."<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a>
<a href="#footnote314"><sup class="sml">314</sup></a></p>

<p>"What we have said with regard to space and time applies
equally tο the case of Causation. Here, too, the finite offered
to perception introduces to an Infinite supplied by thought.
As a definite body reveals also the space around, and an interrupted
succession exhibits the uniform time beneath, so does
the passing phenomenon demand for itself a power beneath.
The space, and time, and power, not being part of the thing
perceived, but its conditions, are guaranteed to us, therefore,
on the warrant, not of sense, but of intellect."<a id="footnotetag315" name="footnotetag315"></a>
<a href="#footnote315"><sup class="sml">315</sup></a></p>

<p>"We conclude, then, on reviewing these examples of Space,
and Time, and Causation, that ontological ideas introducing us
to certain fixed entities belong no less to our knowledge than
scientific ideas of phenomenal disposition and succession."<a id="footnotetag316" name="footnotetag316"></a>
<a href="#footnote316"><sup class="sml">316</sup></a>
In these instances of relation between a phenomenon given in
perception and an entity as a logical condition, the correlatives
are on a perfect equality of intellectual validity, and the relative
character of human thought is not an ontological disqualification,
but a cognitive power.</p>

<p>There is a thread of fallacy running through the whole of
Hamilton's reasonings, consequent upon a false definition of
the Absolute at the outset. The Absolute is defined as <i>that
which exists in and by itself, aloof from and out of all relation</i>.
An absolute, as thus defined, does not and can not exist; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="236" >236</a></span>
a pure abstraction, and, in fact, a pure non-entity. "The Absolute
expresses perfect independence both in being and in
action, and is applicable to God as self-existent."<a id="footnotetag317" name="footnotetag317"></a>
<a href="#footnote317"><sup class="sml">317</sup></a> It may
mean the absence of all <i>necessary</i> relation, but it does not mean
the absence of <i>all</i> relation. If God can not <i>voluntarily</i> call a
finite existence into being, and thus stand in the relation of
cause, He is certainly under the severest limitation. But surely
that is not a limit which substitutes choice for necessity. To
be unable to know God out of all relation--that is, apart from
his attributes, apart from his created universe, is not felt by us
to be any privation at all. A God without attributes, and out
of all relations, is for us no God at all. God as a being of unlimited
perfection, as infinitely wise and good, as the unconditioned
cause of all finite being, and, consequently, as voluntarily
related to nature and humanity, we can and do know; this is
the living and true God. The God of a false philosophy is not
the true God; the pure abstractions of Hegel and Hamilton
are negations, and not realities.</p>

<p>2. We proceed to consider the second fundamental principle
of Hamilton's philosophy of the conditioned, viz., that "conditional
limitation is the fundamental law of the possibility of
thought," and that thought necessarily imposes conditions on
its object.</p>

<p>"Thought," says Hamilton, "can not transcend consciousness:
consciousness is only possible under the antithesis of a
subject and an object known only in correlation, and <i>mutually
limiting each other</i>"<a id="footnotetag318" name="footnotetag318"></a>
<a href="#footnote318"><sup class="sml">318</sup></a> Thought necessarily supposes conditions;
"to think is simply to condition," that is, to predicate limits;
and as the infinite is the unlimited, it can not be thought.
The very attempt to think the infinite renders it finite; therefore
there can be no infinite <i>in thought</i>, and, consequently, the
infinite can not be known.</p>

<p>If by "the infinite in thought" is here meant the infinite
compassed or contained in thought, we readily grant that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="237">237</a></span>
finite can not contain the infinite; it is a simple truism which no
one has ever been so foolish as to deny. Even Cousin is not
so unwise as to assert the absolutely comprehensibility of God.
"In order absolutely to comprehend the Infinite, it is necessary

not granted to us."<a id="footnotetag319" name="footnotetag319"></a>
<a href="#footnote319"><sup class="sml">319</sup></a> A finite mind can not have "an infinite
thought." But it by no means follows that, because we can
not have infinite thought, we can have no clear and definite
thought of or concerning the Infinite. We have a precise and
definite idea of infinitude; we can define the idea; we can set
it apart without danger of being confounded with another, and
we can reason concerning it. There is nothing we more certainly
and intuitively know than that space is infinite, and yet
we can not comprehend or grasp within the compass of our
thought the infinite space. We can not form an <i>image</i> of infinite
space, can not traverse it in perception, or represent it
by any combination of numbers; but we can have the <i>thought</i>

precision and accuracy.<a id="footnotetag320" name="footnotetag320"></a>
<a href="#footnote320"><sup class="sml">320</sup></a> Hamilton has an idea of the Infinite;
he defines it; he reasons concerning it; he says "we must believe
in the infinity of God." But how can he define the Infinite
unless he possesses some knowledge, however limited, of
the infinite Being? How can he believe in the infinity of God
if he has no definite idea of infinitude? He can not reason
about, can not affirm or deny any thing concerning, that of
which he knows absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>The grand logical barrier which Hamilton perpetually interposes
to all possible cognition of God <i>as infinite</i> is, that to
think is to condition--to limit; and as the Infinite is the unconditioned,
the unlimited, therefore "the Infinite can not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="238">238</a></span>
<i>thought</i>." We grant at once that all human thought is limited
and finite, but, at the same time, we emphatically deny that the
limitation of our thought imposes any conditions or limits upon
the object of thought. No such affirmation can be consistently
made, except on the Hegelian hypothesis that "Thought and
Being are identical;" and this is a maxim which Hamilton
himself repudiates. Our thought does not create, neither does
it impose conditions upon, any thing.</p>

<p>There is a lurking sophism in the whole phraseology of
Hamilton in regard to this subject. He is perpetually talking
about "thinking a thing"--"thinking the Infinite." Now we
do not think a thing, but we think <i>of</i> or <i>concerning</i> a thing. We
do not think a man, neither does our thought impose any conditions
upon the man, so that he must be as our thought conceives
or represents him; but our thought is of the man, concerning
or about the man, and is only so far true and valid as
it conforms to the objective reality. And so we do not "think
the Infinite;" that is, our thought neither contains nor conditions
the Infinite Being, but our thoughts are <i>about</i> the Infinite
One; and if we do not think of Him as a being of infinite
perfection, our thought is neither worthy, nor just, nor true.<a id="footnotetag321" name="footnotetag321"></a>

<p>The fallacy of this reasoning consists in confounding a <i>supposed</i>
Quantitative Infinite with <i>the</i> Qualitative Infinite--the totality
of existence with the infinitely perfect One. "Qualitative
infinity is a secondary predicate; that is, the attribute of an attribute,
and is expressed by the adverb <i>infinitely</i> rather than
the adjective <i>infinite</i>. For instance, it is a strict use of language
to say, that space is infinite, but it is an elliptical use of
language to say, God is infinite. Precision of language would
require us to say, God is infinitely good, wise, and great; or
God is good, and his goodness is infinite. The distinction may
seem trivial, but it is based upon an important difference between
the infinity of space and time on the one hand, and the
infinity of God on the other. Neither philosophy nor theology
can afford to disregard the difference. Quantitative Infinity is
illimitation by <i>quantity</i>. Qualitative Infinity is illimitation by
<i>degree</i>. Quantity and degree alike imply finitude, and are categories
of the finite alone. The danger of arguing from the former
kind of infinitude to the latter can not be overstated. God
alone possesses Qualitative Infinity, which is strictly synonymous
with <i>absolute perfection</i>; and the neglect of the distinction
between this and Quantitative Infinity, leads irresistibly to pantheistic
and materialistic notions. Spinozism is possible only
by the elevation of 'infinite extension' to the dignity of a divine
attribute. Dr. Samuel Clarke's identification of God's immensity
with space has been shown by Martin to ultimate in
Pantheism. From ratiocinations concerning the incomprehensibility
of infinite space and time, Hamilton and Mansel pass
at once to conclusions concerning the incomprehensibility of
God. The inconsequence of all such arguments is absolute;
and if philosophy tolerates the transference of spatial or temporal
analogies to the nature of God, she must reconcile herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="240" >240</a></span>
to the negation of his personality and spirituality."<a id="footnotetag325" name="footnotetag325"></a>
<a href="#footnote325"><sup class="sml">325</sup></a> An
Infinite Being, quite remote from the notion of <i>quantity</i>, may
and does exist; which, on the one hand, does not include finite
existence, and, on the other hand, does not render the finite
impossible to thought. Without contradiction they may coexist,
and be correlated.</p>

<p>The thought will have already suggested itself to the mind
of the reader that for Hamilton to assert that the Infinite, as
thus defined (the One and the All), is absolutely unknown, is
certainly the greatest absurdity, for in that case nothing can
be known. This Infinite must be at least partially known, or
all human knowledge is reduced to zero. To the all-inclusive
Infinite every thing affirmative belongs, not only to be, but to
be known. To claim it for being, yet deny it to thought, is
thus impossible. The Infinite, which includes all real existence,
is certainly possible to cognition.</p>

<p>The whole argument as regards the conditionating nature of
all thought is condensed into four words by Spinoza--"<i>Omnis
determinatio est negatio</i>;" all determination is negation. Nothing
can be more arbitrary or more fallacious than this principle.
It arises from the confusion of two things essentially different--<i>the
limits of a being</i>, and <i>its determinate and distinguishing
characteristics</i>. The limit of a being is its imperfection; the
determination of a being is its perfection. The less a thing is
determined, the more it sinks in the scale of being; the most
determinate being is the most perfect being. "In this sense
God is the only being absolutely determined. For there must
be something indetermined in all finite beings, since they have
all imperfect powers which tend towards their development
after an indefinite manner. God alone, the complete Being in
whom all powers are actualized, escapes by His own perfection
from all progress, and development, and indetermination."<a id="footnotetag326" name="footnotetag326"></a>

<p>All real being must be determined; only pure Nothing can be
undetermined. <i>Determination</i> is, however, one thing; and <i>limitation</i>
is essentially another thing. "Even space and time,
though cognized solely by negative characteristics, are determined
in so far as differentiated from the existences they contain;
but this differentiation involves no limitation of their
infinity." If all distinction is determination, and if all determination
is negation, that is (as here used), limitation, then the
infinite, as distinguished from the finite, loses its own infinity,
and either becomes identical with the finite, or else vanishes
into pure nothing. If Hamilton will persist in affirming that
all determination is limitation, he has no other alternatives but
to accept the doctrine of Absolute Nihilism, or of Absolute
Identity. If the Absolute is the indeterminate--that is, no
attributes, no consciousness, no relations--it is pure non-being.
If the Infinite is "the One and All," then there is but one
substance, one absolute entity.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer professes to be carrying out, a step farther,
the doctrine put into shape by Hamilton and Mansel, viz., "the
philosophy of the Unconditioned." In other words, he carries
that doctrine forward to its rigidly logical consequences, and utters
the last word which Hamilton and Mansel dare not utter--"Apprehensible
by us there is no God." The Ultimate
Reality is absolutely unknown; it can not be apprehended by
the human intellect, and it can not present itself to the intellect
at all. This Ultimate Reality can not be <i>intelligent</i>, because
to think is to condition, and the Absolute is the unconditioned;
can not be <i>conscious</i>, because all consciousness is of plurality
and difference, and the Absolute is one; can not be <i>personal</i>,
because personality is determination or limitation, and the Infinite
is the illimitable. It is "audacious," "irreverent," "impious,"
to apply any of these predicates to it; to regard it as
Mind, or speak of it as Righteous.<a id="footnotetag327" name="footnotetag327"></a>
<a href="#footnote327"><sup class="sml">327</sup></a> The ultimate goal of the
philosophy of the Unconditioned is a purely subjective Atheism.</p>

<p>And yet of this Primary Existence--inscrutable, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="242">242</a></span>
absolutely unknown--Spencer knows something; knows as much
as he pleases to know. He knows that this "ultimate of ultimates

<p>3. We advance to the review of the third fundamental principle
of Hamilton's philosophy of the Unconditioned, viz., that
the terms infinite and absolute are names for a "mere negation
of thought"--a "mental impotence" to think, or, in other
words, the absence of all the conditions under which thought is
possible.</p>

<p>This principle is based upon a distinction between "positive"
and "negative" thought, which is made with an air of
wonderful precision and accuracy in "the Alphabet of Human
Thought."<a id="footnotetag333" name="footnotetag333"></a>
<a href="#footnote333"><sup class="sml">333</sup></a> "Thinking is <i>positive</i> when existence is predicated
of an object." "Thinking is <i>negative</i> when existence is not attributed
to an object." "Negative thinking," therefore, is not
the thinking of an object as devoid of this or that particular
attribute, but as devoid of all attributes, and thus of all existence;
that is, it is "the negation of all thought"--<i>nothing</i>.
"When we think a thing, that is done by conceiving it as possessed
of certain modes of being or qualities, <i>and the sum of
these qualities constitutes its concept or notion</i>." "When we perform
an act of negative thought, this is done by thinking <i>something</i>
as <i>not</i> existing in this or that determinate mode; and
when we think it as existing in no determinate mode, <i>we cease
to think at all--it becomes a nothing</i>."<a id="footnotetag334" name="footnotetag334"></a>
<a href="#footnote334"><sup class="sml">334</sup></a> Now the Infinite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="243" >243</a></span>
according to Hamilton, can not be thought in any determinate
mode; therefore we do not think it at all, and therefore it is
for us "a logical Non-entity."</p>

<p>It is barely conceivable that Hamilton might imagine himself
possessed of this singular power of "performing an act of
negative thought"--that is, of thinking and not thinking at
once, or of "thinking something" that "becomes nothing;"
we are not conscious of any such power. To think without an
object of thought, or to think of something without any qualities,
or to think "something" which in the act of thought melts
away into "nothing," is an absurdity and a contradiction. We
can not think about nothing. All thought must have an object,
and every object must have some predicate. Even space
has some predicates--as receptivity, unity, and infinity.
Thought can only be realized by thinking something existing,
and existing in a determinate manner; and when we cease to
think something having predicates, we cease to think at all.
This is emphatically asserted by Hamilton himself.<a id="footnotetag335" name="footnotetag335"></a>
<a href="#footnote335"><sup class="sml">335</sup></a> "Negative
thinking" is, therefore, a meaningless phrase, a contradiction
in terms; it is no thought at all. We are cautioned, however,
against regarding "the negation of thought" as "a negation
of all mental ability." It is, we are told, "an attempt to
think, and a failure in the attempt." An attempt to think
about <i>what</i>? Surely it must be about some object, and an object
which is <i>known</i> by some sign, else there can be no thought.
Let any one make the attempt to think without something to
think about, and he will find that both the process and the result
are blank nothingness. All thought, therefore, as Calderwood
has amply shown, is, must be, <i>positive</i>. "Thought is
nothing else than the comparison of objects known; and as
knowledge is always positive, so must our thought be. All
knowledge implies an object <i>known</i>; and so all thought involves
an object about which we think, and must, therefore, be
positive--that is, it must embrace within itself the conception
of certain qualities as belonging to the object."<a id="footnotetag336" name="footnotetag336"></a>

<p>The conclusion of Hamilton's reasoning in regard to "negative
thinking" is, that we can form no notion of the Infinite
Being. We have no positive idea of such a Being. We can
think of him only by "the thinking away of every characteristic"
which can be conceived, and thus "ceasing to think at
all." We can only form a "negative concept," which, we are
told, "is in fact no concept at all." We can form only a "negative
notion," which, we are informed, "is only the negation of
a notion." This is the impenetrable abyss of total gloom and
emptiness into which the philosophy of the conditions leads us
at last.<a id="footnotetag337" name="footnotetag337"></a>

(return) </a> Whilst Spencer accepts the general doctrine of Hamilton, that the Ultimate
Reality is inscrutable, he argues earnestly against his assertion that
the Absolute is a "mere negation of thought."

<p>"Every one of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the <i>positive existence</i> of something beyond
the relative. To say we can not know the Absolute is, by implication, to
affirm there <i>is</i> an Absolute. In the very denial of our power to learn <i>what</i>
the Absolute is, there lies hidden the assumption <i>that</i> it is; and the making
of this assumption proves that the Absolute has been present to the mind,
not as nothing, but as <i>something</i>. And so with every step in the reasoning
by which the doctrine is upheld, the Noumenon, everywhere named as the
antithesis of the Phenomenon, is throughout thought as actuality. It is
rigorously impossible to conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without, at the same time, conceiving a Reality of which
these are appearances, for appearances without reality are unthinkable.</p>

<p>"Truly to represent or realize in thought any one of the propositions of
which the argument consists, the unconditioned must be represented as <i>positive</i>,
and not negative. How, then, can it be a legitimate conclusion from
the argument that our consciousness of it is negative? An argument, the
very construction of which assigns to a certain term a certain meaning, but
which ends in showing that this term has no meaning, is simply an elaborate
suicide. Clearly, then, the very demonstration that a definite consciousness
[comprehension] of the Absolute is impossible, unavoidably presupposes an
indefinite consciousness of it [an apprehension]."--"First Principles," p. 88.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still we have the word <i>infinite</i>, and we have <i>the notion</i> which
the word expresses. This, at least, is spared to us by Sir William
Hamilton. He who says we have no such notion asks
the question <i>how we have it?</i> Here it may be asked, how
have we, then, the word infinite? How have we the notion
which this word expresses? The answer to this question is
contained in the distinction of positive and negative thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="245">245</a></span></p>

<p>We have a positive concept of a thing when we think of it by
the qualities of which it is the complement. But as the attribution
of qualities is an affirmation, as affirmation and negation
are relatives, and as relatives <i>are known only in and through
each other</i>, we can not, therefore, have a <i>consciousness</i> of the
affirmation of any quality without having, at the same time, the
<i>correlative consciousness</i> of its negation. Now the one consciousness
is a positive, the other consciousness is a negative notion;
and as all language is the reflex of thought, the positive and
negative notions are expressed by positive and negative names.
Thus it is with the Infinite.<a id="footnotetag338" name="footnotetag338"></a>
<a href="#footnote338"><sup class="sml">338</sup></a> Now let us carefully scrutinize
the above deliverance. We are told that "relatives are known
only in and through each other;" that is, such relatives as
<i>finite</i> and <i>infinite</i> are known necessarily in the same act of
thought. The knowledge of one is as necessary as the knowledge
of the other. We can not have a consciousness of the
one without the correlative consciousness of the other. "For,"
says Hamilton, "a relation is, in truth, a thought, one and indivisible;
and while the thinking a relation <i>necessarily involves
the thought of its two terms,</i>, so it is, with equal necessity, itself
involved in the thought of either." If, then, we are <i>conscious</i>
of the two terms of the relation in the same "one and indivisible"
mental act--if we can not have "the consciousness of the
one without the consciousness of the other"--if space and position,
time and succession, substance and quality, infinite and
finite, are given to us in pairs, then 'the <i>knowledge of one is as
necessary as the knowledge of the other,</i>' and they must stand or
fall together. The finite is known no more positively than the
infinite; the infinite is known as positively as the finite. The
one can not be taken and the other left. The infinite, discharged
from all relation to the finite, could never come into
apprehension; and the finite, discharged of all relation to the
infinite, is incognizable too. "There can be no objection to
call the one 'positive' and the other 'negative,' provided it
be understood that <i>each</i> is so with regard to the other, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="246" >246</a></span>
the relation is convertible; the finite, for instance, being the
negative of the infinite, not less than the infinite of the finite."<a id="footnotetag339" name="footnotetag339"></a>

<p>To say that the finite is comprehensible in and by itself, and

<p>A full exposition of Sir William Hamilton's views of <i>Faith</i>
in its connection with Philosophy would have been deeply interesting
to us, and it would have filled up a gap in the interpretation
of his system. The question naturally presents itself,
how would he have discriminated between faith and knowledge,
so as to assign to each its province? If our notion of the Infinite
Being rests entirely upon faith, then upon what ultimate
ground does faith itself rest? On the authority of Scripture,
of the Church, or of reason? The only explicit statement of
his view which has fallen in our way is a note in his edition of
Reid.<a id="footnotetag344" name="footnotetag344"></a>
<a href="#footnote344"><sup class="sml">344</sup></a> "We <i>know</i> what rests upon reason; we <i>believe</i> what
rests upon authority. But reason itself must rest at last upon
authority; for the original data of reason do not rest upon
reason, but are necessarily accepted by reason on the authority
of what is beyond itself. These data are, therefore, in rigid
propriety, Beliefs or Trusts. Thus it is that, in the last resort,
we must, per force, philosophically admit that belief is the primary
condition of reason, and not reason the ultimate ground
of belief."</p>

<p>Here we have, first, an attempted distinction between faith
and knowledge. "We <i>know</i> what rests upon reason;" that is,
whatever we obtain by deduction or induction, whatever is capable
of explication and proof, is <i>knowledge</i>. "We <i>believe</i> what
rests upon authority;" that is, whatever we obtain by intellectual
intuition or pure apperception, and is incapable of explication
and of proof, is "a <i>belief or trust</i>." These instinctive
beliefs, which are, as it were, the first principles upon which all
knowledge rests, are, however, indiscriminately called by Hamilton
"cognitions," "beliefs," "judgments." He declares most
explicitly "that the principles of our knowledge must themselves
be <i>knowledges</i>;"<a id="footnotetag345" name="footnotetag345"></a>
<a href="#footnote345"><sup class="sml">345</sup></a> and these first principles, which are
"the primary condition of reason," are elsewhere called "<i>à
priori cognitions</i>;" also "native, pure, or transcendental <i>knowledge</i>,"
in contradistinction to "<i>à posteriori cognitions</i>," or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="248" >248</a></span>
knowledge which is obtained in the exercise of reason.<a id="footnotetag346" name="footnotetag346"></a>
<a href="#footnote346"><sup class="sml">346</sup></a> All
this confusion results from an attempt to put asunder what
God has joined together. As Clemens of Alexandria has said,
"Neither is faith without knowledge, nor knowledge without
faith." All faith implies knowledge, and all knowledge implies
faith. They are mingled in the one operation of the human
mind, by which we apprehend first principles or ultimate truths.
These have their light and dark side, as Hamilton has remarked.
They afford enough light to show <i>that</i> they are and
must be, and thus communicate knowledge; they furnish no
light to show <i>how</i> they are and <i>why</i> they are, and under that
aspect demand the exercise of faith. There must, therefore,
first be something <i>known</i> before there can be any <i>faith</i>.<a id="footnotetag347" name="footnotetag347"></a>

<p>And now we seem to have penetrated to the centre of Hamilton's
philosophy, and the vital point may be touched by one
crucial question, <i>Upon what ultimate ground does faith itself rest?</i>
Hamilton says, "we believe what rests upon <i>authority</i>." But
what is that authority? I. It is not the authority of Divine
Revelation, because beliefs are called "instinctive," "native,"
"innate," "common," "catholic,"<a id="footnotetag348" name="footnotetag348"></a>
<a href="#footnote348"><sup class="sml">348</sup></a> all which terms seem to indicate
that this "authority" lies within the sphere of the human
mind; at any rate, this faith does not rest on the authority of
Scripture. Neither is it the authority of Reason. "The original
data of reason [the first principles of knowledge] do not
rest upon the authority of reason, but <i>on the authority of what is
beyond itself</i>." The question thus recurs, what is this ultimate
ground beyond reason upon which faith rests? Does it rest
upon any thing, or nothing?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is given in the so-called "Law
of the Conditioned," which is thus laid down: "<i>All that is conceivable
in thought lies between two extremes, which, as contradictory
of each other, can not both be true, but of which, as mutual
contradictories, one must</i>." For example, we conceive <i>space</i>, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="249" >249</a></span>
we can not conceive it as absolutely bounded or infinitely unbounded.
We can conceive <i>time</i>, but we can not conceive it
as having an absolute commencement or an infinite non-commencement.
We can conceive of <i>degree</i>, but we can not conceive
it as absolutely limited or as infinitely unlimited. We
can conceive of <i>existence</i>, but not as an absolute part or an infinite
whole. Therefore, "the Conditioned is that which is
alone conceivable or cogitable; the Unconditioned, that which
is inconceivable or incogitable. The conditioned, or the thinkable,
lies between two extremes or poles; and each of these
extremes or poles are unconditioned, each of them inconceivable,
each of them exclusive or contradictory of the other. Of
these two repugnant opposites, the one is that of Unconditional
or Absolute Limitation; the other that of Unconditional or Infinite
Illimitation, or, more simply, the Absolute and the Infinite;
the term <i>absolute</i> expressing that which is finished or
complete, the term <i>infinite</i> that which can not be terminated or
concluded."<a id="footnotetag349" name="footnotetag349"></a>
<a href="#footnote349"><sup class="sml">349</sup></a></p>

<p>"The conditioned is the mean between two extremes--two
inconditionates, exclusive of each other, neither of which <i>can be
conceived as possible</i>, but of which, on the principle of contradiction,
and excluded middle, <i>one must be admitted as necessary</i>.
We are thus warned from recognizing the domain of our knowledge
as necessarily co-extensive with the horizon of our faith.
And by a <i>wonderful revelation</i>, we are thus, in the very consciousness
of our inability to conceive aught above the relative
and the finite, <i>inspired with a belief in</i> the existence of something
unconditioned beyond the sphere of all comprehensible
reality."<a id="footnotetag350" name="footnotetag350"></a>
<a href="#footnote350"><sup class="sml">350</sup></a> Here, then, we have found the ultimate ground of

<p>Such a faith, however, is built upon the clouds, and the whole
structure of this philosophy is "a castle in the air"--an attempt
to organize Nescience into Science, and evoke something out
of nothing. To pretend to believe in that respecting which
I can form no notion is in reality not to believe at all. The
nature which compels me to believe in the Infinite must supply
me some object upon which my belief can take hold. We can
not believe in contradictions. Our faith must be a rational
belief--a faith in the ultimate harmony and unity of all truth,
in the veracity and integrity of human reason as the organ of
truth; and, above all, a faith in the veracity of God, who is the
author and illuminator of our mental constitution. "We can
not suppose that we are created capable of intelligence in order
to be made victims of delusion--that God is a deceiver, and
the root of our nature a lie."<a id="footnotetag352" name="footnotetag352"></a>
<a href="#footnote352"><sup class="sml">352</sup></a> We close our review of Hamilton
by remarking:</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote352"

<p>1. "The Law of the Conditioned," as enounced by Hamilton,
is contradictory. It predicates contradiction of two extremes,
which are asserted to be equally incomprehensible and
incognizable. If they are utterly incognizable, how does Hamilton
<i>know</i> that they are contradictory? The mutual <i>relation</i>
of two objects is said to be known, but the objects themselves
are absolutely unknown. But how can we know any relation
except by an act of comparison, and how can we compare two
objects so as to affirm their relation, if the objects are absolutely
unknown? "The Infinite is defined as Unconditional Illimitation;
the Absolute as Conditional Limitation. Yet almost in
the same breath we are told that each is utterly inconceivable,
each the mere negation of thought. On the one hand, we are
told they <i>differ</i>; on the other, we are told they do <i>not differ</i>.
Now which does Hamilton mean? If he insist upon the definitions
as yielding a ground of conceivable difference, he must
abandon the inconceivability; but if he insist upon the inconceivability,
he must abandon the definition as sheer verbiage,
devoid of all conceivable meaning. There is no possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="251" >251</a></span>
escape from this dilemma. Further, two negations can never
contradict; for contradiction is the asserting and the denying
of the same proposition; two denials can not conflict. If Illimitation
is negative, Limitation, its contradictory, is positive,
whether conditional or unconditional. In brief, if the Infinite
and Absolute are wholly incomprehensible, they are not distinguishable;
but if they are distinguishable, they are not
wholly incomprehensible. If they are indistinguishable, they
are to us identical; and identity precludes contradiction. But
if they are distinguishable, distinction is made by difference,
which involves positive cognition; hence one, at least, must be
conceivable. It follows, therefore, by inexorable logic, that
either the contradiction or the inconceivability must be abandoned."<a id="footnotetag353" name="footnotetag353"></a>

<p>2. "The Law of the Conditioned," as a ground of faith in
the Infinite Being, is utterly void, meaningless, and ineffectual.
Let us re-state it in Hamilton's own words: "The conditioned
is the <i>mean</i> between two extremes, two inconditionates exclusive
of each other, neither of which <i>can be conceived as possible</i>, but of
which, on the principle of Contradiction and Excluded Middle,
<i>one must be admitted as necessary</i>." It is scarcely needful to explain
to the intelligent reader the above logical principles; that
they may, however, be clearly before the mind in this connection,
we state that the principle of Contradiction is this: "A
thing can not at the same time be and not be; <i>A is</i>, <i>A is not</i>,
are propositions which can not both be true at once." The
principle of Excluded Middle is this: "A thing either is or is
not--<i>A either is or is not B</i>; there is no <i>medium</i>."<a id="footnotetag354" name="footnotetag354"></a>
<a href="#footnote354"><sup class="sml">354</sup></a> Now, to
mention the law of Excluded Middle and two contradictories
with a <i>mean</i> between them, in the same sentence, is really astounding.
"If the two contradictory extremes are equally incogitable,
yet include a cogitable mean, why insist upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="252" >252</a></span>
necessity of accepting either extreme? This necessity of accepting
one of the contradictories is wholly based upon the
supposed impossibility of a <i>mean</i>; if a mean exists, <i>that</i> may
be true, and both contradictories together false. But if a mean
between two contradictories be both impossible and absurd,
Hamilton's 'conditioned' entirely vanishes."<a id="footnotetag355" name="footnotetag355"></a>
<a href="#footnote355"><sup class="sml">355</sup></a> If both contradictories
are equally unknown and equally unthinkable, we can
not discover <i>why</i>, on his principles, we are bound to believe
<i>either</i>.</p>

<p>3. The whole of this confusion in thought and expression
results from the habit of confounding the sensuous imagination
with the non-sensuous reason, and the consequent co-ordination
of an imageable conception with an abstract idea. The
objects of sense and the sensuous imagination may be characterized
as extension, limitation, figure, position, etc.; the objects
of the non-sensuous reason may be characterized as universality,
eternity, infinity. I can form an <i>image</i> of an extended and
figured object, but I can not form an <i>image</i> of space, time, or
God; neither, indeed, can I form an image of Goodness, Justice,
or Truth. But I can have a clear and precise idea of
space, and time, and God, as I can of Justice, Goodness, and
Truth. There are many things which I can most surely <i>know</i>
that I can not possibly <i>comprehend</i>, if to comprehend is to form
a mental image of a thing. There is nothing which I more
certainly know than that space is infinite, and eternity unbeginning
and endless; but I can not comprehend the infinity of
space or the illimitability of eternity. I know that God is, that
he is a being of infinite perfection, but I can not throw my
thoughts around and comprehend the infinity of God.</p>

<p>(iv.) We come, lastly, to consider the position of the <i>Dogmatic
Theologians</i>.<a id="footnotetag356" name="footnotetag356"></a>
<a href="#footnote356"><sup class="sml">356</sup></a> In their zeal to demonstrate the necessity of Divine
Revelation, and to vindicate for it the honor of supplying
to us all our knowledge of God, they assail every fundamental
principle of reason, often by the very weapons which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="253" >253</a></span>
supplied by an Atheistical philosophy. As a succinct presentation
of the views of this school, we select the "<i>Theological Institutes</i>"
of R. Watson.</p>

<p>1st. The invalidity of "<i>the principle of causality</i>" is asserted
by this author. "We allow that the argument which proves
that the <i>effects</i> with which we are surrounded have been <i>caused</i>,
and thus leads us up through a chain of subordinate causes to
one First Cause, has a simplicity, an obviousness, and a force
which, when we are previously furnished with the idea of God,
makes it, at first sight, difficult to conceive that men, under any
degree of cultivation, should be inadequate to it; yet if ever
the human mind commenced such an inquiry at all, it is highly
probable that it would rest in the notion of an <i>eternal succession
of causes and effects</i>, rather than acquire the ideas of creation, in
the proper sense, and of a Supreme Creator."<a id="footnotetag357" name="footnotetag357"></a>
<a href="#footnote357"><sup class="sml">357</sup></a> "We feel that
our reason rests with full satisfaction in the doctrine that all
things are created by one eternal and self-existent Being; but
the Greek philosophers held that matter was eternally co-existent
with God. This was the opinion of Plato, who has been
called the Moses of philosophy."<a id="footnotetag358" name="footnotetag358"></a>
<a href="#footnote358"><sup class="sml">358</sup></a></p>

<p>For a defense of "the principle of causality" we must refer
the reader to our remarks on the philosophy of Comte. We
shall now only remark on one or two peculiarities in the above
statement which betray an utter misapprehension of the nature
of the argument. We need scarcely direct attention to the unfortunate
and, indeed, absurd phrase, "an eternal succession of
causes and effects." An "eternal succession" is a <i>contradictio
in adjecto</i>, and as such inconceivable and unthinkable. No
human mind can "rest" in any such thing, because an eternal
succession is no rest at all. All "succession" is finite and
temporal, capable of numeration, and therefore can not be eternal.<a id="footnotetag359" name="footnotetag359"></a>
<a href="#footnote359"><sup class="sml">359</sup></a>
Again, in attaining the conception of a First Cause the
human mind does not pass up "through a chain of subordinate
causes," either definite or indefinite, "to one First Cause."</p>

<p>Let us re-state the principle of causality as a universal and
necessary law of thought. "<i>All phenomena present themselves to
us as the expression of</i> POWER, and refer us to a causal ground
whence they issue." That "power" is intuitively and spontaneously
apprehended by the human mind as Supreme and Ultimate--"the
causal ground" is a personal God. All the phenomena
of nature present themselves to us as "effects," and we
know nothing of "subordinate causes" except as modes of the
Divine Efficiency.<a id="footnotetag360" name="footnotetag360"></a>
<a href="#footnote360"><sup class="sml">360</sup></a> The principle of causality compels us to
think causation behind nature, and under causation to think of
Volition. "Other forces we have no sort of ground for believing;
or, except by artifices of abstraction, even power of conceiving.
The dynamic idea is either this or nothing; and the
logical alternative assuredly is that nature is either a mere
Time-march of phenomena or an expression of Mind."<a id="footnotetag361" name="footnotetag361"></a>
<a href="#footnote361"><sup class="sml">361</sup></a> The
true doctrine of philosophy, of science, and of revelation is not

<p>The assertion that Plato taught "the eternity of matter,"
and that consequently he did not arrive at the idea of a Supreme
and Ultimate Cause, is incapable of proof. The term
ὕλη = matter does not occur in the writings of Plato, or, indeed,
of any of his predecessors, and is peculiarly Aristotelian. The
ground of the world of sense is called by Plato "the receptacle"
(ὑποδοχή), "the nurse" (τιθήνη) of all that is produced,
and was apparently identified, in his mind, with <i>pure space</i>--a
logical rather than a physical entity--the mere negative condition
and medium of Divine manifestation. He never regards
it as a "cause," or ascribes to it any efficiency. We grant that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="255">255</a></span>
he places this very indefinite something (ὁποιονοῦν τι) out of the
sphere of temporal origination; but it must be borne in mind
that he speaks of "creation in eternity" as well as of "creation
in time;" and of time itself, though created, as "an eternal
image of the generating Father."<a id="footnotetag363" name="footnotetag363"></a>
<a href="#footnote363"><sup class="sml">363</sup></a> This one thing, at any rate,
can not be denied, that Plato recognizes creation in its fullest
sense as the act of God.</p>

<p>The admission that something has always existed besides the
Deity, as a mere logical condition of the exercise of divine power
(<i>e.g.</i>, space), would not invalidate the argument for the existence
of God. The proof of the Divine Existence, as Chalmers
has shown, does not rest on the existence of matter, but on the
orderly arrangement of matter; and the grand question of Theism
is not whether the <i>matter of the world</i>, but whether the <i>present

<p>To this assertion that the connection of things visible and
things invisible, finite and infinite, objects of sense and objects
of faith, is utterly imperceptible to human thought, we might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="256">256</a></span>
reply by quoting the words of that Sacred Book whose supreme
authority our author is seeking, by this argument, to establish.
"The <i>invisible</i> things of God, even his eternal power and god-head,
from the creation, are clearly <i>seen</i>, being <i>understood by the
things which are made</i>." We may also point to the fact that in
every age and in every land the human mind has spontaneously
and instinctively recognized the existence of an invisible Power
and Presence pervading nature and controlling the destinies of
man, and that religious worship--prayer, and praise, and sacrifice--offered
to that unseen yet omnipresent Power is an universal
fact of human nature. The recognition of an <i>immediate</i>
and a <i>necessary</i> "connection" between the visible and the invisible,
the objects of sense and the objects of faith, is one of
the most obvious facts of consciousness--of universal consciousness
as revealed in history, and of individual consciousness
as developed in every rational mind.</p>

<p>That this connection is "not perceptible to human observation,"
if by this our author means "not perceptible to sense,"
we readily admit. No one ever asserted it was perceptible to
human observation. We say that this connection is perceptible
to human <i>reason</i>, and is revealed in every attempt to think
about, and seek an explanation of, the phenomenal world.
The Phenomenal and the Real, Genesis and Being, Space and
Extension, Succession and Duration, Time and Eternity, the
Finite and the Infinite, are correlatives which are given in one
and the same indivisible act of thought. "The conception of
one term of a relation necessarily implies that of the other; it
being the very nature of a correlative to be thinkable only
through the conjunct thought of its correlative; for a relation
is, in truth, a thought one and indivisible; and whilst the
thinking of one relation necessarily involves the thought of its
two terms, so it is, with equal necessity, itself involved in the
thought of either."<a id="footnotetag367" name="footnotetag367"></a>

<p>The reverence which, from boyhood, we have entertained
for the distinguished author of the "Institutes" restrains us
from speaking in adequate terms of reprobation of the statement
that "the <i>First Cause</i>" may be known, and yet not conceived
"as eternal, self-existent, immortal, and independent".
Surely that which is the ground and reason of all existence
must have the ground and reason of its own existence in itself.
That which is <i>first</i> in the order of existence, and in the logical
order of thought, can have nothing prior to itself. If the supposed
First Cause is not necessarily self-existent and independent,
it is not the <i>first</i>; if it has a dependent existence, there
must be a prior being on which it depends. If the First Cause
is not eternal, then prior to this Ultimate Cause there was
nothingness and vacuity, and pure nothing, by its own act, became
something. But "<i>Ex nihilo nihil</i>" is a universal law of
thought. To ask the question whether the First Cause be self-existent
and eternal, is, in effect, to ask the question "who
made God?" and this is not the question of an adult theologian,
but of a little child. Surely Mr. Watson must have
penned the above passage without any reflection on its real

(return) </a> In an article on "the Impending Revolution in Anglo-Saxon Theology"
Methodist Quarterly Review, (July, 1863), Dr. Warren seems to take it for
granted that the "aiteological" and "teleological" arguments for the existence
of God are utterly invalidated by the Dynamical theory of matter.
"Once admit that <i>real power</i> can and does reside in matter, and all these
reasonings fail. If inherent forces of matter are competent to the production
of all the innumerable miracles of movement in the natural world, what
is there in the natural world which they can not produce. If all <i>the exertions
of power</i> in the universe can be accounted for without resort to something
back of, and superior to, nature, what is there which can force the mind
to such a resort?" (p. 463). "Having granted that <i>power</i>, or <i>self-activity</i>, is
a natural attribute of all matter, what right have we to deny it <i>intelligence</i>?"
(p. 465). "<i>Self-moving matter must have thought and design</i>" (p. 469).

<p>It is not our intention to offer an extended criticism of the above positions
in this note. We shall discuss "the Dynamical theory" more fully in
a subsequent work. If the theory apparently accepted by Dr. Warren be
true, that "<i>the ultimate atoms of matter are as uniformly efficient as minds</i>,
and that we have the same ground to regard the force exerted by the one
<i>innate</i> and <i>natural</i> as that exerted by the other" (p. 464), then we grant that
the conclusions of Dr. Warren, as above stated, are unavoidable. We proceed
one step farther, and boldly assert that the existence of God is, on this
hypothesis, incapable of proof, and the only logical position Dr. Warren can
occupy is that of spiritualistic Pantheism.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren asserts that "the Dynamical theory of matter" is now generally
accepted by "Anglo-Saxon <i>naturalists</i>." "One can scarcely open a scientific
treatise without observing the altered stand-point" (p. 160). We confess
that we are disappointed with Dr. Warren's treatment of this simple question
of fact. On so fundamental an issue, the Doctor ought to have given
the name of at least <i>one</i> "naturalist" who asserts that "the ultimate atoms
of matter are as uniformly efficient as minds." Leibnitz, Morrell, Ulrici,
Hickok, the authorities quoted by him, are metaphysicians and idealists of
the extremest school. At present we shall, therefore, content ourselves with
a general denial of this wholesale statement of Dr. Warren; and we shall
sustain that denial by a selection from the many authorities we shall hereafter
present. "No particle of matter possesses within itself the power of
changing its existing state of motion or of rest. Matter has no spontaneous
power either of rest or motion, but is equally susceptible to each as it may
be acted on by <i>external</i> causes" (Silliman's "Principles of Physics," p. 13).
The above proposition is "a truth on which the whole science of mechanical
philosophy ultimately depends" (Encyclopædia Britannica, art. "Dynamics,"
vol. viii. p. 326). "A material substance existing alone in the universe could
not produce any effects. There is not, so far as we know, a self-acting material
substance in the universe" (M'Cosh, "Divine Government, Physical and
Moral," p. 78). "Perhaps the only true indication of matter is <i>inertia</i>."
"The cause of gravitation is <i>not resident</i> in the particles of matter merely,"
but also "<i>in all space</i>" (Dr. Faraday on "Conservation of Force," in "Correlation
and Conservation of Force." (p. 368). He also quotes with approbation
the words of Newton, "That gravity should be innate, inherent, and
essential to matter, is so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has
in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it"
p. 368). "The 'force of gravity' is an improper expression" (p. 340).
"Forces are transformable, indestructible, and, <i>in contradistinction from
matter</i>, imponderable" (p. 346). "The first cause of things is Deity" (Dr.
Mayer, in "Correlation and Conservation of Force," p. 341). "Although
the word <i>cause</i> may be used in a secondary and subordinate sense, as meaning
antecedent forces, yet in an abstract sense it is totally inapplicable; we
can not predicate of any physical agent that it is abstractedly the cause of
another" (p. 15). "Causation is the <i>will</i>," "creation is the act, of God"
Grove on "Correlation of Physical Forces," (p. 199). "Between gravity
and motion it is impossible to establish the equation required for a rightly-conceived
<i>causal</i> relation" ("Correlation and Conservation of Force," p.
253). See also Herschel's "Outlines of Astronomy," p. 234.</p>

<p>It certainly must have required a wonderful effort of imagination on the
part of Dr. Warren to transform "weight" and "density," mere passive
affections of matter, into self-activity, intelligence, thought, and design.
Weight or density are merely relative terms. Supposing one particle or
mass of matter to exist alone, and there can be no attractive or gravitating
force. There must be a cause of gravity which is distinct from matter.</blockquote>

by Watson. "If, however, it were conceded that some glimmerings
of this great truth, the existence of a First Cause,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="259" >259</a></span>

<p>We might answer directly, and at once, that the oneness or
unity of God is necessarily contained in "the very notion of a
First Cause"--a <i>first</i> cause is not many causes, but <i>one</i>. By
a First Cause we do not, however, understand the first of a numerical
series, but an ἀρχή--a principle, itself unbeginning,
which is the source of all beginning. Our categorical answer,
therefore, must be that the unity of God is a sublime deliverance
of reason--God is one God. It is a first principle of
reason that all differentiation and plurality supposes an incomposite
unity, all diversity implies an indivisible identity. The
sensuous perception of a plurality of parts supposes the rational
idea of an absolute unity, which has no parts, as its necessary
correlative. For example, extension is a congeries of indefinitesimal
parts; the continuity of matter, as <i>empirically</i> known
by us, is never absolute. Space is absolutely continuous, incapable
of division into integral parts, illimitable, and, as <i>rationally</i>
known by us, an absolute unity. The cognition of
limited extension, which is the subject of quantitative measurement,
involves the conception of unlimited space, which is the
negation of all plurality and complexity of parts. And so the
cognition of a phenomenal universe in which we see only difference,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="260" >260</a></span>
plurality, and change, implies the existence of a Being
who is absolutely unchangeable, identical, and one.</p>

<p>This law of thought lies at the basis of that universal desire
of unity, and that universal effort to reduce all our knowledge
to unity, which has revealed itself in the history of philosophy,
and also of inductive science. "Reason, intellect, νοῦς, concatenating
thoughts and objects into system, and tending upward
from particular facts to general laws, from general laws
to universal principles, is never satisfied in its ascent till it
comprehends all laws in a single formula, and consummates all
conditional knowledge in the unity of unconditional existence."
"The history of philosophy is only the history of this tendency,
and philosophers have borne ample testimony to its reality.
'The mind,' says Anaxagoras, 'only knows when it subdues its
objects, when it reduces the many to the one.' 'The end of
philosophy,' says Plato, 'is the intuition of unity.' 'All knowledge,'
say the Platonists, 'is the gathering up into one, and the
indivisible apprehension of this unity by the knowing mind.'"<a id="footnotetag370" name="footnotetag370"></a>

<p>This law has been the guiding principle of the Inductive
Sciences, and has led to some of its most important discoveries.
The unity which has been attained in physical science is not,
however, the absolute unity of a material substratum, but a
unity of <i>Will</i> and of <i>Thought</i>. The late discovery of the monogenesis,
reciprocal convertibility, and indestructibility of all
Forces in nature, leads us upward towards the recognition of
one Omnipresent and Omnipotent Will, which, like a mighty
tide, sweeps through the universe and effects all its changes.
The universal prevalence of the same physical laws and numerical
relations throughout all space, and of the same archetypal
forms and teleology of organs throughout all past time, reveals
to us a Unity of Thought which grasps the entire details of the
universe in one comprehensive plan.<a id="footnotetag371" name="footnotetag371"></a>

<p>Now we shall not occupy our space in the elaboration of the
proposition that the universal consciousness of our race, as revealed
in human history, languages, legislations, and sentiments,
bears testimony to the fact that the ideas of right, duty, and responsibility
are native to the human mind; we shall simply
make our appeal to those Sacred Writings whose verdict must
be final with all theologians. That the fundamental principles
of the moral law do exist, subjectively, in all human minds is
distinctly affirmed by Paul, in a passage which deserves to be
regarded as the chief corner-stone of moral science. "The
Gentiles (ἔθνη, heathen), which have not the written law, do by
the guidance of nature (reason or conscience) the works enjoined
by the revealed law; these, having no written law, are
a law unto themselves; who show plainly the works of the law
written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and
also their reasonings one with another, when they accuse, or
else excuse, each other."<a id="footnotetag376" name="footnotetag376"></a>
<a href="#footnote376"><sup class="sml">376</sup></a> To deny this is to relegate the heathen
from all responsibility. For Mr. Watson admits "that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="262" >262</a></span>
will of a superior is not in justice binding unless it be in some
mode sufficiently declared." Now in the righteous adjudgments
of revelation the heathen are "without excuse." The will
of God must, therefore, be "sufficiently declared" to constitute
them accountable. Who will presume to say that the shadowy,
uncertain, variable, easily and unavoidably corrupted medium
of tradition running through forty muddy centuries is a "sufficient
declaration of the will of God?" The law is "written on
the heart" of every man, or all men are not accountable.</p>

<p>Now this "law written within the heart" immediately and
naturally suggests the idea of a Lawgiver who is over us.
This felt presence of Conscience, approving or condemning our
conduct, suggests, as with the speed of the lightning-flash, the
notion of a Judge who will finally call us to account. This
"accusing or excusing of each other," this recognition of good
or ill desert, points us to, and constrains us to recognize, a future
Retribution; so that some hope or fear of another life has
been in all ages a universal phenomenon of humanity.</p>

<p>It is affirmed, however, that whilst this capacity to know
God may have been an original endowment of human nature,
yet, in consequence of the fall, "the understanding and reason
are weakened by the deterioration of his whole intellectual nature."<a id="footnotetag377" name="footnotetag377"></a>

<p>We reverently and believingly accept the teaching of Scripture
as to the depravity of man. We acknowledge that "the
understanding is darkened" by sin. At the same time, we
earnestly maintain that the Scriptures do not teach that the
fundamental laws of mind, the first principles of reason, are
utterly traversed and obliterated by sin, so that man is not able
to recognize the existence of God, and feel his obligation to
Him. "<i>Though they</i>(the heathen) <i>knew God</i> (διότι γνόντες),
they did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful, but became
vain in their imagination, and their foolish hearts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="263">263</a></span>
darkened. They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped
and served the creature <i>more</i> than the Creator." "And
as they did not <i>approve of holding God with acknowledgment</i>, God
delivered them over to an unapproving mind, to work those
things which are not suitable." After drawing a fearful picture
of the darkness and depravity of the heathen, the Apostle adds,
"Who, <i>though they</i> KNOW <i>the law of God</i>, that they who practise
such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but even are
well pleased with those who practise them."<a id="footnotetag379" name="footnotetag379"></a>
<a href="#footnote379"><sup class="sml">379</sup></a> The obvious and
direct teaching of this passage is that the heathen, in the midst
of their depravity and idolatry, are not utterly ignorant of God;
"they <i>know</i> God"--"they <i>know</i> the law of God "--"they worship
Him," though they worship the creature <i>more than</i> Him.
They know God, and are unwilling to "acknowledge God."
"They know the righteousness of God," and are "haters of
God" on account of his purity; and their worshipping of idols
does not proceed from ignorance of God, from an intellectual
inability to know God, but from "corruption of heart," and a
voluntary choice of, and a "pleasure" in, the sinful practices
accompanying idol worship. Therefore, argues the Apostle,
they are "without excuse." The whole drift and aim of the
argument of Paul is, not to show that the heathen were, by
their depravity, incapacitated to know God, but that because
they knew God and knew his righteous law, therefore their depravity
and licentiousness was "inexcusable."</p>

<p>We conclude our review of opposing schools by the re-affirmation
of our position, <i>that God is cognizable by human reason.</i>
The human mind, under the guidance of necessary laws of
thought, is able, from the facts of the universe, to affirm the existence
of God, and to attain some valid knowledge of his character
and will. Every attempt to solve the great problem of
existence, to offer an explanation of the phenomenal world, or
to explore the fundamental idea of reason, when fairly and

<p>Of all the monuments of the greatness of Athens which
have survived the changes and the wastes of time, the
most perfect and the most enduring is her philosophy. The
Propylæa, the Parthenon, and the Erechtheum, those peerless
gems of Grecian architecture, are now in ruins. The magnificent
sculpture of Phidias, which adorned the pediment, and
outer cornice, and inner frieze of these temples, and the unrivalled
statuary of gods and heroes which crowded the platform
of the Acropolis, making it an earthly Olympus, are now no
more, save a few broken fragments which have been carried to
other lands, and, in their exile, tell the mournful story of the
departed grandeur of their ancient home. The brazen statue
of Minerva, cast from the spoils of Marathon, which rose in
giant grandeur above the buildings of the Acropolis, and the
flashing of whose helmet plumes was seen by the mariner as
soon as he had rounded the Sunian promontory; and that other
brazen Pallas, called, by pre-eminence, "the Beautiful;" and
the enormous Colossus of ivory and of gold, "the Immortal
Maid"--the protecting goddess of the Parthenon--these have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="266">266</a></span>
perished. But whilst the fingers of time have crumbled the
Pentelic marble, and the glorious statuary has been broken to
pieces by vandal hands, and the gold and brass have been
melted in the crucibles of needy monarchs and converted into
vulgar money, the philosophic <i>thought</i> of Athens, which culminated
in the dialectic of Plato, still survives. Not one of all
the vessels, freighted with immortal thought, which Plato
launched upon the stream of time, has foundered. And after
the vast critical movement of European thought during the
past two centuries, in which all philosophic systems have been
subjected to the severest scrutiny, the <i>method</i> of Plato still preserves,
if not its exclusive authority unquestioned, at least its
intellectual pre-eminence unshaken. "Platonism is immortal,
because its principles are immortal in the human intellect and

<p>Philosophy is, then, the world-enduring monument of the
greatness and the glory of Athens. Whilst Greece will be forever
memorable as "the country of wisdom and of wise men,"
Athens will always be pre-eminently memorable as the University
of Greece. This was the home of Socrates, and Plato, and
Aristotle--the three imperial names which, for twenty centuries,
reigned supreme in the world of philosophic thought. Here
schools of philosophy were founded to which students were attracted
from every part of the civilized world, and by which an
impulse and a direction was given to human thought in every
land and in every age. Standing on the Acropolis at Athens,
and looking over the city and the open country, the Apostle
would see these <i>places</i> which are inseparably associated with the
names of the men who have always been recognized as the great
teachers of the pagan world, and who have also exerted a powerful
influence upon Christian minds of every age. "In opposite
directions he would see the suburbs where Plato and Aristotle,
the two pupils of Socrates, held their illustrious schools. The
streamless bed of the Ilissus passes between the Acropolis and
Hymettus in a south-westerly direction, until it vanishes in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="267">267</a></span>
low ground which separates the city from the Piræus." Looking
towards the upper part of this channel, Paul would see
gardens of plane-trees and thickets of angus-castus, "with other
torrent-loving shrubs of Greece." Near the base of Lycabettus
was a sacred inclosure which Pericles had ornamented with
fountains. Here stood a statue of Apollo Lycius, which gave
the name to the <i>Lyceum</i>. Here, among the plane-trees, Aristotle
<i>walked</i>, and, as he walked, taught his disciples. Hence
the name Peripatetics (the Walkers), which has always designated
the disciples of the Stagirite philosopher.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the city, the most beautiful of the
Athenian suburbs, we have the scene of Plato's teaching. Beyond
the outer Ceramicus, which was crowded with the sepulchres
of those Athenians who had fallen in battle, and were
buried at the public expense, the eye of Paul would rest on the
favored stream of the Cephisus, flowing towards the west. On
the banks of this stream the <i>Academy</i> was situated. A wall,
built at great expense by Hipparchus, surrounded it, and Cimon
planted long avenues of trees and erected fountains. Beneath
the plane-trees which shaded the numerous walks there assembled
the master-spirits of the age. This was the favorite resort
of poets and philosophers. Here the divine spirit of Plato
poured forth its sublimest speculations in streams of matchless
eloquence; and here he founded a school which was destined
to exert a powerful and perennial influence on human minds
and hearts in all coming time.</p>

<p>Looking down from the Acropolis upon the Agora, Paul
would distinguish a cloister or colonnade. This is the Stoa
Pœcile, or "Painted Porch," so called because its walls were
decorated with fresco paintings of the legendary wars of Greece,
and the more glorious struggle at Marathon. It was here that
Zeno first opened that celebrated school which thence received
the name of <i>Stoic</i>. The site of the <i>garden</i> where Epicurus
taught is now unknown. It was no doubt within the city walls,
and not far distant from the Agora. It was well known in the
time of Cicero, who visited Athens as a student little more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="268">268</a></span>
a century before the Apostle. It could not have been forgotten
in the time of Paul. In this "tranquil garden," in the society
of his friends, Epicurus passed a life of speculation and of pleasure.
His disciples were called, after him, the Epicureans.<a id="footnotetag381" name="footnotetag381"></a>

<p>Here, then, in Athens the Apostle was brought into immediate
contact with all the phases of philosophic thought which
had appeared in the ancient world. "Amongst those who
sauntered beneath the cool shadows of the plane-trees in the
Agora, and gathered in knots under the porticoes, eagerly discussing
the questions of the day, were the philosophers, in the
garb of their several sects, ready for any new question on which
they might exercise their subtlety or display their rhetoric."
If there were any in that motley group who cherished the principles
and retained the spirit of the true Platonic school, we
may presume they felt an inward intellectual sympathy with the
doctrine enounced by Paul. With Plato, "philosophy was only
another name for <i>religion</i>: philosophy is the love of perfect
Wisdom; perfect Wisdom and perfect Goodness are identical:
the perfect Good is God himself; philosophy is the love of
God."<a id="footnotetag382" name="footnotetag382"></a>
<a href="#footnote382"><sup class="sml">382</sup></a> He confessed the need of divine assistance to attain
"the good," and of divine interposition to deliver men from
moral ruin.<a id="footnotetag383" name="footnotetag383"></a>
<a href="#footnote383"><sup class="sml">383</sup></a> Like Socrates, he longed for a supernatural--a

continually.<a id="footnotetag384" name="footnotetag384"></a>
<a href="#footnote384"><sup class="sml">384</sup></a> He was one of those who, in heathen lands,
waited for "the desire of nations;" and, had he lived in Christian
times, no doubt his "spirit of faith" would have joyfully
"embraced the Saviour in all the completeness of his revelation
and advent."<a id="footnotetag385" name="footnotetag385"></a>
<a href="#footnote385"><sup class="sml">385</sup></a> And in so far as the spirit of Plato survived
among his disciples, we may be sure they were not among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="269">269</a></span>
number who "mocked," and ridiculed, and opposed the "new
doctrine" proclaimed by Paul. It was "the philosophers of
the Epicureans and of the Stoics who <i>encountered</i> Paul." The
leading tenets of both these sects were diametrically opposed
to the doctrines of Christianity. The ruling spirit of each was
alien from the spirit of Christ. The haughty <i>pride</i> of the Stoic,
the Epicurean abandonment to <i>pleasure</i>, placed them in direct
antagonism to him who proclaimed the crucified and risen
Christ to be "<i>the wisdom</i> of God."</p>

<p>If, however, we would justly appreciate the relation of pagan
philosophy to Christian truth, we must note that, when Paul arrived
in Athens, the age of Athenian glory had passed away.
Not only had her national greatness waned, and her national
spirit degenerated, but her intellectual power exhibited unmistakable
signs of exhaustion, and weakness, and decay. If philosophy
had borne any fruit, of course that fruit remained. If,
in the palmy days of Athenian greatness, any field of human
inquiry had been successfully explored; if human reason had
achieved any conquests; if any thing true and good had been
obtained, that must endure as an heir-loom for all coming time;
and if those centuries of agonizing wrestlings with nature, and
of ceaseless questioning of the human heart, had yielded no
results, then, at least, the <i>lesson</i> of their failure and defeat remained
for the instruction of future generations. Either the
problems they sought to solve were proved to be insoluble, or
their methods of solution were found to be inadequate; for
here the mightiest minds had grappled with the great problems
of being and of destiny. Here vigorous intellects had struggled
to pierce the darkness which hangs alike over the beginning
and the end of human existence. Here profoundly earnest
men had questioned nature, reason, antiquity, oracles, in the
hope they might learn something of that invisible world of <i>real</i>
being which they instinctively felt must lie beneath the world
of fleeting forms and ever-changing appearances. Here philosophy
had directed her course towards every point in the
compass of thought, and touched every <i>accessible</i> point. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="270" >270</a></span>
sun of human reason had reached its zenith, and illuminated
every field that lay within the reach of human ken. And this
sublime era of Greek philosophy is of inestimable value to us
who live in Christian times, because <i>it is an exhaustive effort of
human reason to solve the problem of being</i>, and in its history we
have a record of the power and weakness of the human mind,
at once on the grandest scale and in the fairest characters.<a id="footnotetag386" name="footnotetag386"></a>

<p>These preliminary considerations will have prepared the way
for, and awakened in our minds a profound interest in, the inquiry--1st.
What permanent <i>results</i> has Greek philosophy bequeathed
to the world? 2d. In what manner did Greek philosophy
fulfill for Christianity a <i>propœdeutic</i> office?</p>

<p>It will at once be obvious, even to those who are least conversant
with our theme, that it would be fruitless to attempt
the answer to these important questions before we have made
a careful survey of the entire history of philosophic thought in
Greece. We must have a clear and definite conception of the
problems they sought to solve, and we must comprehend their
methods of inquiry, before we can hope to appreciate the results
they reached, or determine whether they did arrive at any
definite and valuable conclusions. It will, therefore, devolve
upon us to present a brief and yet comprehensive epitome of
the history of Grecian speculative thought.</p>

<p>"<i>Philosophy</i>," says Cousin, "<i>is reflection</i>, and nothing else
than reflection, in a vast form"--"Reflection elevated to the
rank and authority of a <i>method</i>." It is the mind looking back
upon its own sensations, perceptions, cognitions, ideas, and
from thence to the <i>causes</i> of these sensations, cognitions, and
ideas. It is thought passing beyond the simple perceptions of
things, beyond the mere spontaneous operations of the mind in
the cognition of things to seek the <i>ground</i>, and <i>reason</i>, and <i>law</i>
of things. It is the effort of reason to solve the great problem
of "Being and Becoming," of appearance and reality, of the
changeful and the permanent. Beneath the endless diversity
of the universe, of existence and action, there must be a principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="271">271</a></span>
of unity; below all fleeting appearances there must be a
permanent substance; beyond this everlasting flow and change,
this beginning and ending of finite existence, there must be an
<i>eternal being</i>, the source and cause of all we see and know,
<i>What is that principle of unity, that permanent substance</i>, or principle,
or being?</p>

<p>This fundamental question has assumed three separate
forms or aspects in the history of philosophy. These forms
have been determined by the objective phenomena which most
immediately arrested and engaged the attention of men. If
external nature has been the chief object of attention, then the
problem of philosophy has been, <i>What is the ἀρχή--</i>the beginning;
what are the first principles<i>--the elements from which, the
ideas or laws according to which, the efficient cause or energy by
which, and the reason or end for which the universe exists?</i> During
this period reflective thought was a PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE.
If the phenomena of mind--the opinions, beliefs, judgments of
men--are the chief object of attention, then the problem of
philosophy has been, <i>What are the fundamental Ideas which are
unchangeable and permanent amid all the diversities of human
opinions, connecting appearance with reality, and constituting a
ground of certain knowledge or absolute truth?</i> Reflective
thought is now a PHILOSOPHY OF IDEAS. Then, lastly, if the practical
activities of life and the means of well-being be the grand
object of attention, then the problem of philosophy has been,
<i>What is the ultimate standard by which, amid all the diversities
of human conduct, we may determine what is right and good in individual,
social, and political life?</i> And now reflective thought
is a PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE. These are the grand problems with
which philosophy has grappled ever since the dawn of reflection.
They all appear in Greek philosophy, and have a marked
chronology. As systems they succeed each other, just as rigorously
as the phenomena of Greek civilization.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="272">272</a></span>
The Greek schools of philosophy have been classified from
various points of view. In view of their geographical relations,

they have been divided into the <i>Ionian</i>, the <i>Italian</i>, the <i>Eleatic</i>,
the <i>Athenian</i>, and the <i>Alexandrian</i>. In view of their prevailing
spirit and tendency, they have been classified by Cousin as the
Sensational, the Idealistic, the Skeptical, and the Mystical.
The most natural and obvious method is that which (regarding
Socrates as the father of Greek philosophy in the truest sense)
arranges all schools from the Socratic stand point, and therefore
in the chronological order of development:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16"><b>I. THE PRE-SOCRATIC SCHOOLS.</b></p>
<p class="i16"><b>II. THE SOCRATIC SCHOOLS.</b></p>
<p class="i16"><b>III. THE POST-SOCRATIC SCHOOLS.</b></p>
</div></div>

<p>The history of philosophy is thus divided into three grand
epochs. The first reaching from Thales to the time of Socrates
(B.C. 639-469): the second from the birth of Socrates to the
death of Aristotle (B.C. 469-322); the third from the death of
Aristotle to the Christian era (B.C. 322, A.D. 1). Greek philosophy
during the first period was almost exclusively a philosophy
of nature; during the second period, a philosophy of mind;
during the last period, a philosophy of life. Nature, man, and
society complete the circle of thought. Successive systems, of
course, overlap each other, both in the order of time and as
subjects of human speculation; and the results of one epoch
of thought are transmitted to and appropriated by another;
but, in a general sense, the order of succession has been very
much as here indicated. Setting aside minor schools and
merely incidental discussions, and fixing our attention on the
general aspects of each historic period, we shall discover that
the first period was eminently <i>Physical</i>, the second <i>Psychological</i>,
the last <i>Ethical</i>. Every stage of progress which reason, on
<i>à priori</i> grounds, would suggest as the natural order of thought,
or of which the development of an individual mind would furnish
an analogy, had a corresponding realization in the development
of Grecian thought from the time of Thales to the
Christian era. "Thought," says Cousin, "in the first trial of
its strength is drawn without." The first object which engages
the attention of the child is the outer world. He asks the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="273">273</a></span>
"<i>how</i>" and "<i>why</i>" of all he sees. His reason urges him to
seek an explanation of the universe. So it was in the <i>childhood</i>
of philosophy. The first essays of human thought were,
almost without exception, discourses περὶ φύσεως (De rerum natura),
of the nature of things. Then the rebound of baffled
reason from the impenetrable bulwarks of the universe drove
the mind back upon itself. If the youth can not interpret
nature, he can at least "know himself," and find within himself
the ground and reason of all existence. There are "<i>ideas</i>"
in the human mind which are copies of those "<i>archetypal ideas</i>"
which dwell in the Creative Mind, and after which the universe
was built. If by "analysis" and "definition" these universal
notions can be distinguished from that which is particular and
contingent in the aggregate of human knowledge, then so much
of eternal truth has been attained. The achievements of philosophic
thought in this direction, during the Socratic age, have
marked it as the most brilliant period in the history of philosophy--the
period of its <i>youthful</i> vigor. Deeply immersed in
the practical concerns and conflicts of public life, <i>manhood</i> is
mainly occupied with questions of personal duty, and individual
and social well-being. And so, during the hopeless turmoil
of civil disturbance which marked the decline of national
greatness in Grecian history, philosophy was chiefly occupied
with questions of personal interest and personal happiness.
The poetic enthusiasm with which a nobler age had longed for
<i>truth</i>, and sought it as the highest good, has all disappeared,
and now one sect seeks refuge from the storms and agitations
of the age in Stoical indifference, the other in Epicurean effeminacy.</p>

<p>If now we have succeeded in presenting the real problem
of philosophy, it will at once be obvious that the inquiry was
not, in any proper sense, <i>theological</i>. Speculative thought, during
the period we have marked as the era of Greek philosophy,
was not an inquiry concerning the existence or nature of God,
or concerning the relations of man to God, or the duties which
man owes to God. These questions were all remitted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="274" >274</a></span>
<i>theologian</i>. There was a clear line of demarkation separating
the domains of religion and philosophy. Religion rested
solely on authority, and appealed to the instinctive faith of the
human heart. She permitted no encroachment upon her settled
usages, and no questioning of her ancient beliefs. Philosophy
rested on reason alone. It was an independent effort of
thought to interpret nature, and attain the fundamental grounds
of human knowledge--to find an ἀρχή--a first principle, which,
being assumed, should furnish a rational explanation of all existence.
If philosophy reach the conclusion that the άρχή was
water, or air, or fire, or a chaotic mixture of all the elements or
atoms, extended and self-moved, or monads, or τὸ πᾶν, or uncreated
mind, and that conclusion harmonized with the ancient
standards of religious faith--well; if not, philosophy must present
some method of conciliation. The conflicts of faith and
reason; the stragglings of traditional authority to maintain
supremacy; the accommodations and conciliations attempted
in those primitive times, would furnish a chapter of peculiar
interest, could it now be written.</p>

<p>The poets who appeared in the dim twilight of Grecian civilization--Orpheus,
Musæus, Homer, Hesiod--seem to have occupied
the same relation to the popular mind in Greece which
the Bible now sustains to Christian communities.<a id="footnotetag387" name="footnotetag387"></a>
<a href="#footnote387"><sup class="sml">387</sup></a> Not that
we regard them as standing on equal ground of authority, or
in any sense a revelation. But, in the eye of the wondering
Greek, they were invested with the highest sacredness and the
supremest authority. The high poetic inspiration which pervaded
them was a supernatural gift. Their sublime utterances
were accepted as proceeding from a divine afflatus. They were
the product of an age in which it was believed by all that the gods
assumed a human form,<a id="footnotetag388" name="footnotetag388"></a>
<a href="#footnote388"><sup class="sml">388</sup></a> and held a real intercourse with gifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="275" >275</a></span>
men. This universal faith is regarded by some as being a
relic of still more distant times, a faint remembrance of the
glory of patriarchal days. The more natural opinion is, that it
was begotten of that universal longing of the human heart for
some knowledge of that unseen world of real being, which man
instinctively felt must lie beyond the world of fleeting change
and delusive appearances. It was a prolepsis of the soul,
reaching upward towards its source and goal. The poet felt
within him some native affinities therewith, and longed for some
stirring breath of heaven to sweep the harp-strings of the soul.
He invoked the inspiration of the Goddess of Song, and waited
for, no doubt believed in, some "deific impulse" descending on
him. And the people eagerly accepted his utterance as the
teaching of the gods. They were too eager for some knowledge
from that unseen world to question their credentials.
Orpheus, Hesiod, Homer, were the θεολόγοι--the theologians
of that age.<a id="footnotetag389" name="footnotetag389"></a>

<p>These ancient poems, then, were the public documents of
the religion of Greece--the repositories of the national faith.
And it is deserving of especial note that the philosopher was
just as anxious to sustain his speculations by quoting the high
traditional authority of the ancient theologian, as the propounder
of modern novelties is to sustain his notions by the
authority of the Sacred Scriptures. Numerous examples of
this solicitude will recur at once to the remembrance of the
student of Plato. All encroachments of philosophy upon the
domains of religion were watched as jealously in Athens in the
sixth century before Christ, as the encroachments of science
upon the fields of theology were watched in Rome in the seventeenth
century after Christ. The court of the Areopagus was
as earnest, though not as fanatical and cruel, in the defense of
the ancient faith, as the court of the Inquisition was in the defense
of the dogmas of the Romish Church. The people, also,
as "the sacred wars" of Greece attest, were ready quickly to
repel every assault upon the majesty of their religion. And so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="276" >276</a></span>
philosophy even had its martyrs. The tears of Pericles were
needed to save Aspasia, because she was suspected of philosophy.
But neither his eloquence nor his tears could save his
friend Anaxagoras, and he was ostracized. Aristotle had the
greatest difficulty to save his life. And Plato was twice imprisoned,
and once sold into slavery.<a id="footnotetag390" name="footnotetag390"></a>

<p>It is unnecessary that we should, in this place, again attempt
the delineation of the theological opinions of the earlier
periods of Grecian civilization. That the ancient Greeks believed
in <i>one Supreme God</i> has been conclusively proved by
Cudworth. The argument of his fourth chapter is incontrovertible.<a id="footnotetag391" name="footnotetag391"></a>
<a href="#footnote391"><sup class="sml">391</sup></a>
However great the number of "generated gods"
who crowded the Olympus, and composed the ghostly array
of Greek mythology, they were all subordinate agents, "demiurges,"
employed in the framing of the world and all material
things, or else the ministers of the moral and providential government
of the εἷς θεὸς ἀγέντος--the one uncreated God. Beneath,
or beyond the whole system of pagan polytheism, we
recognize a faith in an <i>Uncreated Mind</i>, the Source of all the intelligence,
and order, and harmony which pervades the universe
the Fountain of law and justice; the Ruler of the world;
the Avenger of injured innocence; and the final Judge of men.
The immortality of the soul and a state of future retribution
were necessary corollaries of this sublime faith. This primitive
theology was unquestionably the people's faith; the faith, also,
of the philosopher, in his inmost heart, however far he might
wander in speculative thought. The instinctive feeling of the
human heart, the spontaneous intuitions of the human reason,
have led man, in every age, to recognize a God. It is within
the fields of speculative thought that skepticism has had its
birth. Any thing like atheism has only made its appearance
amid the efforts of human reason to explain the universe. The
native sentiments of the heart and the spontaneous movements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="277" >277</a></span>
of the reason have always been towards faith, that is, towards
"a religious movement of the soul."<a id="footnotetag392" name="footnotetag392"></a>
<a href="#footnote392"><sup class="sml">392</sup></a> Unbridled speculative
thought, which turns towards the outer world alone, and disregards
"the voices of the soul," tends towards <i>doubt</i> and irreligion.
But, as Cousin has said, "a complete extravagance, a
total delusion (except in case of real derangement), is impossible."
"Beneath reflection there is still spontaneity, when the
scholar has denied the existence of a God; listen to the man,
interrogate him unawares, and you will see that all his words
betray the idea of a God, and that faith in a God is, without
his recognition, at the bottom of his heart."<a id="footnotetag393" name="footnotetag393"></a>

<p>Let us not, therefore, be too hasty in representing the early
philosophers as destitute of the idea of a God, because in the
imperfect and fragmentary representations which are given us
of the philosophical opinions of Thales, and Anaximenes, and
Heraclitus, and Diogenes of Apollonia, we find no explicit allusions
to the <i>Uncreated Mind</i> as the first principle and cause of
all. A few sentences will comprehend the whole of what remains
of the opinions of the earliest philosophers, and these
were transmitted for ages by <i>oral</i> tradition. To Plato and
Aristotle we are chiefly indebted for a stereotype of those scattered,
fragmentary sentences which came to their hands through
the dim and distorting medium of more than two centuries.
Surely no one imagines these few sentences contain and sum
up the results of a lifetime of earnest thought, or represent all
the opinions and beliefs of the earliest philosophers! And
should we find therein no recognition of a personal God,
would it not be most unfair and illogical to assert that they
were utterly ignorant of a God, or wickedly denied his being?
If they say "there is no God," then they are foolish Atheists;
if they are silent on that subject, we have a right to assume
they were Theists, for it is most natural to believe in God.
And yet it has been quite customary for Christian teachers,
after the manner of some Patristic writers, to deny to those
early sages the smallest glimpse of underived and independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="278" >278</a></span>
knowledge of a Divine Being, in their zeal to assert for the
Sacred Scriptures the exclusive prerogative of revealing Him.</p>

<p>Now in regard to the theological opinions of the Greek philosophers,
we shall venture this general <i>lemma</i>--<i>the majority of
them recognized an "incorporeal substance"</i><a id="footnotetag394" name="footnotetag394"></a>
<a href="#footnote394"><sup class="sml">394</sup></a><i> an uncreated Intelligence,
an ordering, governing Mind</i>. Leucippus, Democritus,
and Epicurus, who were Materialists, are perhaps the only exceptions.
Many of them were Pantheists, in the higher form
of Pantheism, which, though it associates the universe with its
framer and mover, still makes "the moving principle" superior
to that which is moved. The world was a living organism,</p>

<p class="mid">"Whose body nature is, and God the soul."</p>

<p>Unquestionably most on them recognized the existence of <i>two</i>
first principles, substances essentially distinct, which had co-existed
from eternity--an incorporeal Deity and matter.<a id="footnotetag395" name="footnotetag395"></a>
<a href="#footnote395"><sup class="sml">395</sup></a> We
grant that the free production of a universe by a creative fiat--the
calling of matter into being by a simple act of omnipotence--is
not elementary to human reason. The famous physical
axiom of antiquity, "<i>De nihilo nihil, in nihilum posse reverti"</i>
under one aspect, may be regarded as the expression of the
universal consciousness of a mental inability to conceive a
creation out of nothing, or an annihilation.<a id="footnotetag396" name="footnotetag396"></a>
<a href="#footnote396"><sup class="sml">396</sup></a> "We can not conceive,
either, on the one hand, nothing becoming something, or
something becoming nothing, on the other hand. When God

<p>Those writers<a id="footnotetag398" name="footnotetag398"></a>
<a href="#footnote398"><sup class="sml">398</sup></a> are, therefore, clearly in error who assert that
the earliest question of Greek philosophy was, What is God?
and that various and discordant answers were given, Thales
saying, water is God, Anaximenes, air; Heraclitus, fire; Pythagoras,
numbers; and so on. The idea of God is a native
intuition of the mind. It springs up spontaneously from the
depths of the human soul. The human mind naturally recognizes
God as an uncreated Mind, and recognizes itself as "the
offspring of God." And, therefore, it is simply impossible for
it to acknowledge water, or air, or fire, or any material thing to
be its God. Now they who reject this fundamental principle
evidently misapprehend the real problem of early Grecian philosophic
thought. The external world, the material universe,
was the first object of their inquiry, and the method of their inquiry
was, at the first stage, purely physical. Every object of
sense had a beginning and an end; it rose out of something,
and it fell back into something. Beneath this ceaseless flow
and change there must be some permanent principle. What
is that στοιχεῖον--that first element? The changes in the universe
seem to obey some principle of law--they have an orderly
succession. What is that µορφή--that form, or ideal, or archetype,
proper to each thing, and according to which all things
are produced? These changes must be produced by some
efficient cause, some power or being which is itself immobile,
and permanent, and eternal, and adequate to their production.
What is that ἀρχὴ τῆς κινήσεως--that first principle of movement
Then, lastly, there must be an end for which all things
exist--a good reason why things are as they are, and not otherwise.
What is that τὸ οὗ ἕνεκεν καῖ τὸ ἀγαθόν--that reason and
good of all things? Now these are all ἀρχαί or first principles
of the universe. "Common to all first principles," says Aristotle,
"is the being, the original, from which a thing is, or is produced,
or is known."<a id="footnotetag399" name="footnotetag399"></a>
<a href="#footnote399"><sup class="sml">399</sup></a> First principles, therefore, include both
elements and causes, and, under certain aspects, elements are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="280" >280</a></span>
also causes, in so far as they are that without which a thing can
not be produced. Hence that highest generalization by Aristotle
of all first principles; as--1. The Material Cause; 2. The
Formal Cause; 3. The Efficient Cause; 4. The Final Cause.
The grand subject of inquiry in ancient philosophy was not
alone what is the final <i>element</i> from which all things have been
produced? nor yet what is the <i>efficient cause</i> of the movement
and the order of the universe? <i>but what are those First Principles
which, being assumed, shall furnish a rational explanation
of all phenomena, of all becoming?</i></p>

<p>So much being premised, we proceed to consider the efforts
and the results of philosophic thought in</p>

<p class="mid"><b>THE PRE-SOCRATIC SCHOOLS.</b></p>

<p>"The first act in the drama of Grecian speculation was performed
on the varied theatre of the Grecian colonies--Asiatic,
insular, and Italian, verging at length (in Anaxagoras) towards
Athens." During the progress of this drama two distinct
schools of philosophy were developed, having distinct geographical
provinces, one on the east, the other on the west, of
the peninsula of Greece, and deriving their names from the
localities in which they flourished. The earliest was the <i>Ionian;</i>
the latter was the <i>Italian</i> school.</p>

<p>It would be extremely difficult, at this remote period, to estimate
the influence which geographical conditions and ethnical
relations exerted in determining the course of philosophic
thought in these schools. Unquestionably those conditions
contributed somewhat towards fixing their individuality. At
the same time, it must be granted that the distinction in these
two schools of philosophy is of a deeper character than can be
represented or explained by geographical surroundings; it is a
distinction reaching to the very foundation of their habits of
thought. These schools represent two distinct aspects of philosophic
thought, two distinct methods in which the human
mind has essayed to solve the problem of the universe.</p>

<p>The ante-Socratic schools were chiefly occupied with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="281" >281</a></span>
study of external nature. "Greek philosophy was, at its first
appearance, a philosophy of nature." It was an effort of the
reason to reach a "first principle" which should explain the
universe. This early attempt was purely speculative. It
sought to interpret all phenomena by <i>hypotheses</i>, that is, by
suppositions, more or less plausible, suggested by physical analogies
or by <i>à priori</i> rational conceptions.</p>

<p>Now there are two distinct aspects under which nature presents
itself to the observant mind. The first and most obvious
is the <i>simple phenomena</i> as perceived by the senses. The second
is the <i>relations</i> of <i>phenomena</i>, cognized by the reason alone.
Let phenomena, which are indeed the first objects of perception,
continue to be the chief and almost exclusive object of thought,
and philosophy is on the highway of pure physics. On the
other hand, instead of stopping at phenomena, let their relations
become the sole object of thought, and philosophy is now
on the road of purely mathematical or metaphysical abstraction.
Thus two schools of philosophy are developed, the one SENSATIONAL,
the other IDEALIST. Now these, it will be found, are
the leading and characteristic tendencies of the two grand divisions
of the pre-Socratic schools; the Ionian is <i>sensational</i>,
the Italian is <i>idealist</i>.</p>

<p>These two schools have again been the subject of a further
subdivision based upon diverse habits of thought. The Ionian
school sought to explain the universe by <i>physical analogies.</i>
Of these there are two clear and obvious divisions--analogies
suggested by living organisms, and analogies suggested by mechanical
arrangements. One class of philosophers in the Ionian
school laid hold on the first analogy. They regarded the
world as a living being, spontaneously evolving itself--a vital
organism whose successive developments and transformations
constitute all visible phenomena. A second class laid hold
on the analogy suggested by mechanical arrangements. For
them the universe was a grand superstructure, built up from
elemental particles, arranged and united by some ab-extra
power or force, or else aggregated by some inherent mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="282" >282</a></span>
affinity. Thus we have two sects of the Ionian school; the
first, <i>Dynamical</i> or vital; the second, <i>Mechanical</i>.<a id="footnotetag400" name="footnotetag400"></a>
<a href="#footnote400"><sup class="sml">400</sup></a></p>

<p>The Italian school sought to explain the universe by rational
conceptions and <i>à priori</i> ideas. Now to those who seek, by
simple reflection, to investigate the relations of the external
world this marked distinction will present itself: some are relations
<i>between</i> sensible phenomena--relations of time, of place,
of number, of proportion, and of harmony; others are relations
<i>of</i> phenomena to essential being--relations of qualities to substance,
of becoming to being, of the finite to the infinite. The
former constituted the field of Pythagorean the latter of Eleatic
contemplation. The Pythagoreans sought to explain the universe
by numbers, forms, and harmonies; the Eleatics by the
<i>à priori</i> ideas of unity, substance, Being <i>in se</i>, the Infinite.
Thus were constituted a <i>Mathematical</i> and a <i>Metaphysical</i> sect
in the Italian school. The pre-Socratic schools may, therefore,
be tabulated in the following order:</p>

<pre>
I. IONIAN (Sensational),   (1.) PHYSICAL {Dynamical or Vital.
                                       {Mechanical.

II. Italian (Idealist),    {(2.) MATHEMATICAL Pythagoreans.
                           {(3.) METAPHYSICAL Eleatics.
</pre>

<p>I. <i>The Ionian or Physical School.</i>--We have premised that
the philosophers of this school attempted the explanation of
the universe by physical analogies.</p>

<p>One class of these early speculators, the <i>Dynamical</i>, or vital
theorists, proceeded on the supposition of a living energy infolded
in nature, which in its spontaneous development continuously
undergoes alteration both of quality and form. This
imperfect analogy is the first hypothesis of childhood. The
child personifies the stone that hurts him, and his first impulse
is to resent the injury as though he imagined it to be endowed
with consciousness, and to be acting with design. The childhood
of superstition (whose genius is multiplicity) personifies
each individual existence--a rude Fetichism, which imagines a
supernatural power and presence enshrined in every object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="283" >283</a></span>
nature, in every plant, and stock, and stone. The childhood
of philosophy (whose genius is unity) personifies the universe.
It regards the earth as one vast organism, animated by one
soul, and this soul of the world as a "created god."<a id="footnotetag401" name="footnotetag401"></a>
<a href="#footnote401"><sup class="sml">401</sup></a> The first
efforts of philosophy were, therefore, simply an attempt to explain
the universe in harmony with the popular theological beliefs.
The cosmogonies of the early speculators in the Ionian
school were an elaboration of the ancient theogonies, but still
an elaboration conducted under the guidance of that law of
thought which constrains man to seek for <i>unity</i>, and reduce the
many to the one.</p>

<p>Therefore, in attempting to construct a theory of the universe
they commenced by postulating an ἀρχή--a first principle or
element out of which, by a <i>vital</i> process, all else should be produced. "Accordingly, whatever seemed the most subtle or pliable,
as well as <i>universal</i> element in the mass of the visible
world, was marked as the seminal principle whose successive
developments and transformations produced all the rest."<a id="footnotetag402" name="footnotetag402"></a>
<a href="#footnote402"><sup class="sml">402</sup></a>
With this seminal principle the living, <i>animating</i> principle
seems to have been associated--in some instances perhaps
confounded, and in most instances called by the same name.
And having pursued this analogy so far, we shall find the
<i>most decided and conclusive</i> evidence of a tendency to regard
the soul of man as similar, in its nature, to the soul which animates
the world.</p>

<p><i>Thales of Miletus</i>(B.C. 636-542) was the first to lead the way
in the perilous inquiry after an ἀρχή, or first principle, which
should furnish a rational explanation of the universe. Following,
as it would seem, the genealogy of Hesiod, he supposed
<i>water</i> to be the primal element out of which all material things
were produced. Aristotle supposes he was impressed with this
idea from observing that all things are nourished by moisture;
warmth itself, he declared, proceeded from moisture; the seeds
of all things are moist; water, when condensed, becomes earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="284" >284</a></span>
Thus convinced of the universal presence of water, he declared
it to be the first principle of things.<a id="footnotetag403" name="footnotetag403"></a>
<a href="#footnote403"><sup class="sml">403</sup></a></p>

<p>And now, from this brief statement of the Thalean physics,
are we to conclude that he recognized only a <i>material</i> cause of
the universe? Such is the impression we receive from the
reading of the First Book of Aristotle's Metaphysics. His evident
purpose is to prove that the first philosophers of the Ionian
school did not recognize an <i>efficient</i> cause. In his opinion, they
were decidedly materialistic. Now to question the authority of
Aristotle may appear to many an act of presumption. But
Aristotle was not infallible; and nothing is more certain than
that in more than one instance he does great injustice to his
predecessors.<a id="footnotetag404" name="footnotetag404"></a>
<a href="#footnote404"><sup class="sml">404</sup></a> To him, unquestionably, belongs the honor of
having made a complete and exhaustive classification of causes,
but there certainly does appear something more than vanity in
the assumption that he, of all the Greek philosophers, was the
only one who recognized them all. His sagacious classification
was simply a resumè of the labors of his predecessors. His
"principles" or "causes" were incipient in the thought of the
first speculators in philosophy. Their accurate definition and
clearer presentation was the work of ages of analytic thought.
The phrases "efficient," "formal," "final" cause, are, we grant,
peculiar to Aristotle; the ideas were equally the possession of
his predecessors.</p>

<p>The evidence, we think, is conclusive that, with this primal
element (water), Thales associated a formative principle of motion;
to the "material" he added the "efficient" cause. A
strong presumption in favor of this opinion is grounded on the
psychological views of Thales. The author of "De Placitis
Philosophorum" associates him with Pythagoras and Plato, in
teaching that the soul is incorporeal, making it naturally self-active,
and an intelligent substance.<a id="footnotetag405" name="footnotetag405"></a>
<a href="#footnote405"><sup class="sml">405</sup></a> And it is admitted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="285" >285</a></span>
Aristotle (rather unwillingly, we grant, but his testimony is all
the more valuable on that account) that, in his time, the opinion
that the soul is a principle, ἀεικίνητον--ever moving, or essentially
self-active, was currently ascribed to Thales. "If we
may rely on the notices of Thales, he too would seem to have
conceived the soul as a <i>moving principle</i>."<a id="footnotetag406" name="footnotetag406"></a>
<a href="#footnote406"><sup class="sml">406</sup></a> Extending this
idea, that the soul is a moving principle, he held that all motion
in the universe was due to the presence of a living soul.
"He is reported to have said that the loadstone possessed a
soul because it could move iron."<a id="footnotetag407" name="footnotetag407"></a>
<a href="#footnote407"><sup class="sml">407</sup></a> And he taught that "the
world itself is <i>animated</i>, and full of gods."<a id="footnotetag408" name="footnotetag408"></a>
<a href="#footnote408"><sup class="sml">408</sup></a> "Some think that
<i>soul</i> and <i>life</i> is mingled with the whole universe; and thence,
perhaps, was that [opinion] of Thales that all things are full of
gods,"<a id="footnotetag409" name="footnotetag408"></a>
<a href="#footnote409"><sup class="sml">409</sup></a> portions, as Aristotle said, of the universal soul. These
views are quite in harmony with the theology which makes
the Deity the moving energy of the universe--the energy
which wrought the successive transformations of the primitive
aqueous element. They also furnish a strong corroboration of
the positive statement of Cicero--"Aquam, dixit Thales, esse
initium rerum, Deum autem eam mentem quæ ex aqua cuncta
fingeret." Thales said that water is the first principle of things,
but God was that mind which formed all things out of water;<a id="footnotetag410" name="footnotetag410"></a>
<a href="#footnote410"><sup class="sml">410</sup></a>
as also that still more remarkable saying of Thales, recorded
by Diogenes Laertius; "God is the most ancient of all things,
for he had no birth; the world is the most beautiful of all
things, for it is the workmanship of God."<a id="footnotetag411" name="footnotetag411"></a>
<a href="#footnote411"><sup class="sml">411</sup></a> We are aware that
some historians of philosophy reject the statement of Cicero,
because, say they, "it does violence to the chronology of speculation."<a id="footnotetag412" name="footnotetag412"></a>
<a href="#footnote412"><sup class="sml">412</sup></a>
Following Hegel, they assert that Thales could have
no conception of God as Intelligence, since that is a conception
of a more advanced philosophy. Such an opinion may be
naturally expected from the philosopher who places God, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="286" >286</a></span>
at the commencement, but at the <i>end</i> of things, God becoming
conscious and intelligent in humanity. If, then, Hegel teaches
that God himself has had a progressive development, it is no
wonder he should assert that the idea of God has also had an
historic development, the <i>last</i> term of which is an <i>intelligent
God</i>. But he who believes that the idea of God as the infinite
and the perfect is native to the human mind, and that God
stands at the beginning of the entire system of things, will feel
there is a strong <i>à priori</i> ground for the belief that Thales recognized
the existence of an <i>intelligent God who fashioned the
universe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Anaximenes of Miletus</i> (B.C. 529-480) we place next to
Thales in the consecutive history of thought. It has been
usual to rank Anaximander next to the founder of the Ionian
School. The entire complexion of his system is, however, unlike
that of a pupil of Thales. And we think a careful consideration
of his views will justify our placing him at the head
of the Mechanical or Atomic division of the Ionian school.
Anaximenes is the historical successor of Thales; he was unquestionably
a vitalist. He took up the speculation where
Thales had left it, and he carried it a step forward in its development.<a id="footnotetag413" name="footnotetag413"></a>
<a href="#footnote413"><sup class="sml">413</sup></a></p>

<p>Pursuing the same method as Thales, he was not, however,
satisfied with the conclusion he had reached. Water was not
to Anaximenes the most significant, neither was it the most
universal element. But air seemed universally present. "The
earth was a broad leaf resting upon it. All things were produced
from it; all things were resolved into it. When he
breathed he drew in a part of this universal life. All things
are nourished by air."<a id="footnotetag414" name="footnotetag414"></a>
<a href="#footnote414"><sup class="sml">414</sup></a> Was not, therefore, <i>air</i> the ἀρχή, or primal
element of things?</p>

<p>This brief notice of the physical speculations of Anaximenes
is all that has survived of his opinions. We search in vain for
some intimations of his theological views. On this merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="287" >287</a></span>
negative ground, some writers have unjustly charged him with
Atheism. Were we to venture a conjecture, we would rather
say that there are indications of a tendency to Pantheism in
that form of it which associates God necessarily with the universe,
but does not utterly confound them. His fixing upon
"<i>air</i>" as the primal element, seems an effort to reconcile, in
some apparently intermediate substance, the opposite qualities
of corporeal and spiritual natures. Air is invisible, impalpable,
all-penetrating, and yet in some manner appreciable to sense.
May not the vital transformations of this element have produced
all the rest? The writer of the Article on Anaximenes
in the Encyclopædia Britannica tells us (on what ancient authorities
he saith not) that "he asserted this air was God, since
the divine power resides in it and agitates it."</p>

<p>Some indications of the views of Anaximenes may perhaps
be gathered from the teachings of Diogenes of Apollonia (B.C.
520-490,) who was the disciple, and is generally regarded as
the commentator and expounder of the views of Anaximenes.
The air of Diogenes was a soul; therefore it was <i>living</i>, and not
only living, but conscious and <i>intelligent</i>. "It knows much,"
says he; "for without <i>reason</i> it would be impossible for all to
be arranged duly and proportionately; and whatever objects
we consider will be found to be so arranged and ordered in the
best and most beautiful manner."<a id="footnotetag415" name="footnotetag415"></a>
<a href="#footnote415"><sup class="sml">415</sup></a> Here we have a distinct
recognition of the fundamental axiom that <i>mind is the only valid
explanation of the order and harmony which pervades the universe</i>.
With Diogenes the first principle is a "divine air,"
which is vital, conscious, and intelligent, which spontaneously
evolves itself, and which, by its ceaseless transformations, produces
all phenomena. The soul of man is a detached portion
of this divine element; his body is developed or evolved therefrom.
The theology of Diogenes, and, as we believe, of his
master, Anaximenes also, was a species of Materialistic Pantheism.</p>

<p><i>Heraclitus of Ephesus</i>(B.C. 503-420) comes next in the order
of speculative thought. In his philosophy, <i>fire</i> is the ἀρχή, or
first principle; but not fire in the usual acceptation of that
term. The Heraclitean "fire" is not flame, which is only an
intensity of fire, but a warm, dry vapor--an <i>ether</i>, which may
be illustrated, perhaps, by the "caloric" of modern chemistry.
This "<i>ether</i>" was the primal element out of which the universe
was formed; it was also a vital power or principle which animated
the universe, and, in fact, the <i>cause</i> of all its successive
phenomenal changes. "The world," he said, "was neither
made by the gods nor men, and it was, and is, and ever shall
be, an <i>ever-living fire</i>, in due proportion self-enkindled, and in
due measure self-extinguished."<a id="footnotetag416" name="footnotetag416"></a>
<a href="#footnote416"><sup class="sml">416</sup></a> The universe is thus reduced
to "an eternal fire," whose ceaseless energy is manifested
openly in the work of dissolution, and yet secretly, but universally,
in the work of renovation. The phenomena of the universe
are explained by Heraclitus as "the concurrence of opposite
tendencies and efforts in the motions of this ever-living fire,
out of which results the most beautiful harmony. This harmony

<p>Heraclitus was the first to proclaim the doctrine of the perpetual
fluxion of the universe (τὸ ῥέον, τὸ γιγνόµενον--Unrest
and Development), the endless changes of matter, and the mutability
and perishability of all individual things. This restless,
changing flow of things, which never <i>are</i>, but always are <i>becoming</i>,
he pronounced to be the <i>One</i> and the <i>All</i>.</p>

<p>From this statement of the physical theory of Heraclitus we
might naturally infer that he was a Hylopathean Atheist. Such
an hypothesis would not, however, be truthful or legitimate. On
a more careful examination, his system will be found to stand
half-way between the materialistic and the spiritual conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="289">289</a></span>
of the Author of the universe, and marks, indeed, a transition
from the one to the other. Heraclitus unquestionably held
that all substance is material, for a philosopher who proclaims,
as he did, that the senses are the only source of knowledge,
must necessarily attach himself to a material element as the
primary one. And yet he seems to have <i>spiritualized</i> matter.
"The moving unit of Heraclitus--the Becoming--is as immaterial
as the resting unit of the Eleatics--the Being."<a id="footnotetag418" name="footnotetag418"></a>
<a href="#footnote418"><sup class="sml">418</sup></a> The
Heraclitean "<i>fire</i>" is endowed with <i>spiritual</i> attributes. "Aristotle
calls it ψυχή--soul, and says that it is ἀσωµατώτατον, or
absolutely incorporeal ("De Anima," i. 2. 16). It is, in effect,
the common ground of the phenomena both of mind and matter
it is not only the animating, but also the intelligent and
regulating principle of the universe; the Ξυνὸς Λόγος, or universal
Word or Reason, which it behooves all men to follow."<a id="footnotetag419" name="footnotetag419"></a>
<a href="#footnote419"><sup class="sml">419</sup></a>
The psychology of Heraclitus throws additional light upon his
theological opinions. With him human intelligence is a detached
portion of the Universal Reason. "Inhaling," said he,
"through the breath the Universal Ether, which is Divine Reason,
we become conscious." The errors and imperfections of
humanity are consequently to be ascribed to a deficiency of the
Divine Reason in man. Whilst, therefore, the theory of Heraclitus
seems to materialize mind, it may, with equal fairness, be
said to spiritualize matter.</p>

<p>The general inference, therefore, from all that remains of
the doctrine of Heraclitus is that he was a Materialistic Pantheist.
His God was a living, rational, intelligent Ether--a
soul pervading the universe. The form of the universe, its
ever-changing phenomena, were a necessary emanation from, or
a perpetual transformation of, this universal soul.</p>

<p>With Heraclitus we close our survey of that sect of the physical
school which regarded the world as a living organism.</p>

<p>The second subdivision of the physical school, <i>the Mechanical</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="290" >290</a></span>
or <i>Atomist theorists</i>, attempted the explanation of the universe
by analogies derived from mechanical collocations, arrangements,
and movements. The universe was regarded by
them as a vast superstructure built up from elemental particles,
aggregated by some inherent force or mutual affinity.</p>

<p><i>Anaximander of Miletus</i> (born B.C. 610) we place at the head
of the Mechanical sect of the Ionian school; first, on the authority
of Aristotle, who intimates that the philosophic dogmata
of Anaximander "resemble those of Democritus," who was certainly
an Atomist; and, secondly, because we can clearly trace
a genetic connection between the opinions of Democritus and
Leucippus and those of Anaximander.</p>

<p>The ἀρχή, or first principle of Anaximander, was τὸ ἄπειρον,
<i>the boundless, the illimitable, the infinite</i>. Some historians of
philosophy have imagined that the infinite of Anaximander was
the "unlimited all," and have therefore placed him at the head
of the Italian or "idealistic school." These writers are manifestly
in error. Anaximander was unquestionably a sensationalist.
Whatever his "infinite" may be found to be, one thing
is clear, it was not a "metaphysical infinite"--it did not include
infinite power, much less infinite mind.</p>

<p>The testimony of Aristotle is conclusive that by "the infinite"
Anaximander understood the multitude of primary, material
particles. He calls it "a µῖγµα, or mixture of elements."<a id="footnotetag420" name="footnotetag420"></a>
<a href="#footnote420"><sup class="sml">420</sup></a>
It was, in fact, a <i>chaos</i>--an original state in which the primary
elements existed in a chaotic combination without <i>limitation</i> or
division. He assumed a certain "<i>prima materia</i>," which was
neither air, nor water, nor fire, but a "mixture" of all, to be
the first principle of the universe. The account of the opinions
of Anaximander which is given by Plutarch ("De Placita," etc.)
is a further confirmation of our interpretation of his infinite.
"Anaximander, the Milesian, affirmed the infinite to be the
first principle, and that all things are generated out of it, and
corrupted again into it. <i>His infinite is nothing else but matter.</i>"
"Whence," says Cudworth, "we conclude that Anaximander's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="291" >291</a></span>
infinite was nothing else but an infinite chaos of matter, in
which were actually or potentially contained all manner of
qualities, by the fortuitous secretion and segregation of which
he supposed infinite worlds to be successively generated and
corrupted. So that we may easily guess whence Leucippus
and Democritus had their infinite worlds, and perceive how
near akin these two Atheistic hypotheses were."<a id="footnotetag421" name="footnotetag421"></a>
<a href="#footnote421"><sup class="sml">421</sup></a> The reader,
whose curiosity may lead him to consult the authorities collected
by Cudworth (pp. 185-188), will find in the doctrine of
Anaximander a rude anticipation of the modern theories of
"spontaneous generation" and "the transmutation of species."
In the fragments of Anaximander that remain we find no recognition
of an ordering Mind, and his philosophy is the dawn
of a Materialistic school.</p>

things. "Leucippus (and his companion, Democritus) assert

<p>He also taught that the elements, and the worlds derived
from them, are <i>infinite</i>. He describes the manner in which
the worlds are produced as follows: "Many bodies of various

in their movements by a dark negation of intelligence,
designated "Fate," and all traces of a Supreme Mind disappear
in his philosophy. It is a system of pure materialism,

<p>The psychological opinions of Democritus were as decidedly
materialistic as his physical theories. All knowledge is derived
from sensation. It is only by material impact that we
can know the external world, and every sense is, in reality, a
kind of touch. Material images are being continually thrown
off from the surface of external objects which come into actual
contact with the organs of sense. The primary qualities of
matter, that is, those which are involved in extension in space,
are the only objects of real knowledge; the secondary qualities
of matter, as softness, hardness, sweetness, bitterness, and
the like, are but modifications of the human sensibilities.
"The sweet exists only in form--the bitter in form, hot in
form, color in form; but in causal reality only atoms and
space exist. The sensible things which are supposed by opinion

<p>Thus by Democritus was laid the basis of a system of absolute
materialism, which was elaborated and completed by Epicurus,
and has been transmitted to our times. It has undergone
some slight modifications, adapting it to the progress of
physical science; but it is to-day substantially the theory of
Democritus. In Democritus we have the culmination of the
mechanical theory of the Ionian or Physical school. In physics
and psychology it terminated in pure materialism. In theology
it ends in positive Atheism.</p>

<p>The fundamental error of all the philosophers of the physical
school was the assumption, tacitly or avowedly, that sense-perception
is the only source of knowledge. This was the fruitful
source of all their erroneous conclusions, the parent of all their
materialistic tendencies. This led them continually to seek
an ἀρχή, or first principle of the universe, which should, under
some form, be appreciable to <i>sense</i>; and consequently the
course of thought tended naturally towards materialism.</p>

<p>Thales was unquestionably a dualist. Instructed by traditional
intimations, or more probably guided by the spontaneous
apperceptions of reason, he recognized, with more or less distinctness,
an incorporeal Deity as the moving, animating, and
organizing cause of the universe. The idea of God is a truth
so self-evident as to need no demonstration. The human mind
does not attain to the idea of a God as the last consequence of
a series of antecedent principles. It comes at once, by an inherent
and necessary movement of thought, to the recognition
of God as the First Principle of all principles. But when, instead
of hearkening to the simple and spontaneous intuitions
of the mind, man turns to the world of sense, and loses himself
in discursive thought, the conviction of a personal God becomes
obscured. Then, amid the endlessly diversified phenomena of
the universe, he seeks for a cause or origin which in some form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="294">294</a></span>
shall be appreciable to sense. The mere study of material
phenomena, scientifically or unscientifically conducted, will
never yield the sense of the living God. Nature must be interpreted,
can only be interpreted in the light of certain <i>à priori</i>
principles of reason, or we can never "ascend from nature
up to nature's God." Within the circle of mere sense-perception,
the dim and undeveloped consciousness of God will be
confounded with the universe. Thus, in Anaximenes, God is
partially confounded with "air," which becomes a symbol; then
a vehicle of the informing mind; and the result is a semi-pantheism.
In Heraclitus, the "ether" is, at first, a semi-symbol
of the Deity; at length, God is utterly confounded with this
ether, or "rational fire," and the result is a definite <i>materialistic
pantheism</i>. And, finally, when this feeling or dim consciousness
of God, which dwells in all human souls, is not only disregarded,
but pronounced to be an illusion--a phantasy; when
all the analogies which intelligence suggests are disregarded,
and a purely mechanical theory of the universe is adopted, the
result is the utter negation of an Intelligent Cause, that is, <i>absolute
Atheism</i>, as in Leucippus and Democritus.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we commenced our inquiry with the
assumption that, in the absence of the true inductive method
of philosophy which observes, and classifies, and generalizes
facts, and thence attains a general principle or law, two only
methods were possible to the early speculators who sought an
explanation of the universe--1st, That of reasoning from physical
analogies; or, 2d, That of deduction from rational conceptions,
or <i>à priori</i> ideas.</p>

<p>Accordingly we found that one class of speculators fixed
their attention solely on the mere phenomena of nature, and
endeavored, amid sensible things, to find a <i>single</i> element
which, being more subtile, and pliable, and universally diffused,
could be regarded as the ground and original of all the
rest, and from which, by a vital transformation, or by a mechanical
combination and arrangement of parts, all the rest
should be evolved. The other class passed beyond the simple
phenomena, and considered only the abstract <i>relations</i> of phenomena
among themselves, or the relations of phenomena to
the necessary and universal ideas of the reason, and supposed
that, in these relations, they had found an explanation of the
universe. The former was the Ionian or Sensation school;
the latter was the Italian or Idealist school.</p>

<p>We have traced the method according to which the Ionian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="296">296</a></span>
school proceeded, and estimated the results attained. We
now come to consider the method and results of</p>

<p class="mid"><b>THE ITALIAN OR IDEALIST SCHOOL.</b></p>

<p>This school we have found to be naturally subdivided into--1st,
The <i>Mathematical</i> sect, which attempted the explanation
of the universe by the abstract conceptions of number, proportion,
order, and harmony; and, 2d, The <i>Metaphysical</i> school,
which attempted the interpretation of the universe according
to the <i>à priori</i> ideas of unity, of Being <i>in se</i>, of the Infinite, and
the Absolute.</p>

<p><i>Pythagoras of Samos</i>(born B.C. 605) was the founder of the
Mathematical school.</p>

<p>We are conscious of the difficulties which are to be encountered
by the student who seeks to attain a definite comprehension
of the real opinions of Pythagoras. The genuineness of
many of those writings which were once supposed to represent
his views, is now questioned. "Modern criticism has clearly
shown that the works ascribed to Timæus and Archytas are
spurious; and the treatise of Ocellus Lucanus on 'The Nature
of the All' can not have been written by a Pythagorean."<a id="footnotetag427" name="footnotetag427"></a>
<a href="#footnote427"><sup class="sml">427</sup></a>
The only writers who can be regarded as at all reliable are
Plato and Aristotle; and the opinions they represent are not
so much those of Pythagoras as "the Pythagoreans." This is
at once accounted for by the fact that Pythagoras taught in
secret, and did not commit his opinions to writing. His disciples,
therefore, represent the <i>tendency</i> rather than the actual
tenets of his system; these were no doubt modified by the
mental habits and tastes of his successors.</p>

<p>We may safely assume that the proposition from which

<p>Are we then required to accept the dictum of Aristotle as
final and decisive? Did Pythagoras really teach that numbers
are real entities--the <i>substance</i> and cause of all other existences?
The reader may be aware that this is a point upon
which the historians of philosophy are not agreed. Ritter is
decidedly of opinion that the Pythagorean formula "can only
be taken symbolically."<a id="footnotetag431" name="footnotetag431"></a>
<a href="#footnote431"><sup class="sml">431</sup></a> Lewes insists it must be understood
literally.<a id="footnotetag432" name="footnotetag432"></a>
<a href="#footnote432"><sup class="sml">432</sup></a> On a careful review of all the arguments, we are
constrained to regard the conclusion of Ritter as most reasonable.
The hypothesis "that numbers are real entities" does
violence to every principle of common sense. This alone constitutes
a strong <i>à priori</i> presumption that Pythagoras did not
entertain so glaring an absurdity. The man who contributed
so much towards perfecting the mathematical sciences, who
played so conspicuous a part in the development of ancient
philosophy, and who exerted so powerful a determining influence
on the entire current of speculative thought, did not obtain
his ascendency over the intellectual manhood of Greece
by the utterance of such enigmas. And further, in interpreting
the philosophic opinions of the ancients, we must be guided
by this fundamental canon--"The human mind has, under the
necessary operation of its own laws, been compelled to entertain
the same fundamental ideas, and the human heart to cherish
the same feelings in all ages." Now if a careful philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="298">298</a></span>
criticism can not render the <i>reported</i> opinions of an ancient
teacher into the universal language of the reason and
heart of humanity, we must conclude either that his opinions
were misunderstood and misrepresented by some of his successors,
or else that he stands in utter isolation, both from the
present and the past. His doctrine has, then, no relation to
the successions of thought, and no place in the history of philosophy.
Nay, more, such a doctrine has in it no element of
vitality, no germ of eternal truth, and must speedily perish.
Now it is well known that the teaching of Pythagoras awakened
the deepest intellectual sympathy of his age; that his doctrine
exerted a powerful influence on the mind of Plato, and,
through him, upon succeeding ages; and that, in some of its
aspects, it now survives, and is more influential to-day than in
any previous age; but this element of immutable and eternal
truth was certainly not contained in the inane and empty formula,
"that numbers are real existences, the causes of all other
existences!" If the fame of Pythagoras had rested on such
"airy nothings," it would have melted away before the time of
Plato.</p>

<p>We grant there is considerable force in the argument of
Lewes. He urges, with some pertinence, the unquestionable
fact that Aristotle asserts, again and again, that the Pythagoreans
taught "that numbers are the principles and substance
of things as well as the causes of their modifications;" and he
argues that we are not justified in rejecting the authority of
Aristotle, unless better evidence can be produced.</p>

<p>So far, however, as the authority of Aristotle is concerned,
even Lewes himself charges him, in more than one instance,
with strangely misrepresenting the opinions of his predecessors.<a id="footnotetag433" name="footnotetag433"></a>
<a href="#footnote433"><sup class="sml">433</sup></a>
Aristotle is evidently wanting in that impartiality which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="299">299</a></span>
ought to characterize the historian of philosophy, and, sometimes,
we are compelled to question his integrity. Indeed,
throughout his "Metaphysics" he exhibits the egotism and
vanity of one who imagines that he alone, of all men, has the
full vision of the truth. In Books I. and XII. he uniformly associates
the "<i>numbers</i>" of Pythagoras with the "<i>forms</i>" and
"<i>ideas</i>" of Plato. He asserts that Plato identifies "forms"
and "numbers," and regards them as real entities--substances,
and causes of all other things. "<i>Forms are numbers</i><a id="footnotetag434" name="footnotetag434"></a>
<a href="#footnote434"><sup class="sml">434</sup></a>... so
Plato affirmed, similar with the Pythagoreans; and the dogma

<a href="#footnote435"><sup class="sml">435</sup></a> And then, finally, he

(return) </a> "Aristotle uniformly speaks disparagingly of Anaxagoras" (Lewes's

mind (νοῦς) simply as "a <i>machine</i>" for the production of the world;--"when
he finds himself in perplexity as to the cause of its being necessarily
an orderly system, he then drags it (mind) in by force to his assistance"
"Metaphysics," (bk. i. ch. iv.). But he is evidently inconsistent with himself,
for in "De Anima" (bk. i. ch. ii.) he tells us that "Anaxagoras saith that
mind is at once a <i>cause of motion</i> in the whole universe, and also of <i>well</i> and
<i>fit</i>." We may further ask, is not the idea of fitness--of the good and the
befitting--the final cause, even according to Aristotle?

<p>He also totally misrepresents Plato's doctrine of "Ideas." "Plato's
Ideas," he says, "are substantial existences--real beings" ("Metaphysics,"
bk. i. ch. ix.). Whereas, as we shall subsequently show, "they are objects
of pure conception for human reason, and they are attributes of the Divine
Reason. It is there they substantially exist." (Cousin, "History of Philosophy,"
vol. i. p. 415). It is also pertinent to inquire, what is the difference
between the "formal cause" of Aristotle and the archetypal ideas of Plato?
and is not Plato's τὸ ἀγαθόν the "final cause?" Yet Aristotle is forever
congratulating himself that he alone has properly treated the "formal" and
the "final cause!"</blockquote>

<p>It is, however, a matter of the deepest interest for us to find
the evidence gleaming out here and there, on the pages of Aristotle,
that he had some knowledge of the fact that the Pythagorean
numbers were regarded as <i>symbols</i>. The "numbers"
of Pythagoras are, in the mind of Aristotle, clearly identified
with the "forms" of Plato. Now, in Chapter VI. of the First
Book he says that Plato taught that these "forms" were
παραδείγµατα--models, patterns, exemplars after which created
things were framed. The numbers of Pythagoras, then, are
also models and exemplars. This also is admitted by Aristotle.
The Pythagoreans indeed affirm that entities subsist by
an <i>imitation</i> (µίµησις) of numbers.<a id="footnotetag437" name="footnotetag437"></a>
<a href="#footnote437"><sup class="sml">437</sup></a> Now if ideas, forms, numbers,
were the models or paradigms after which "the Operator"
formed all things, surely it can not be logical to say they
were the "material" out of which all things were framed, much
less the "efficient cause" of things. The most legitimate conclusion
we can draw, even from the statements of Aristotle, is
that the Pythagoreans regarded numbers as the best expression
or representation of those laws of proportion, and order,
and harmony, which seemed, to their eyes, to pervade the universe.
Their doctrine was a faint glimpse of that grand discovery
of modern science--that all the higher laws of nature
assume the form of a precise quantitative statement.</p>

<p>The fact seems to be this, the Pythagoreans busied themselves
chiefly with what Aristotle designates "the <i>formal</i>
cause," and gave little attention to the inquiry concerning "the
<i>material</i> cause." This is admitted by Aristotle. Concerning
fire, or earth, or the other bodies of such kind, they have declared
nothing whatsoever, inasmuch as affirming, in my opinion,
nothing that is peculiar concerning <i>sensible</i> natures.<a id="footnotetag438" name="footnotetag438"></a>
<a href="#footnote438"><sup class="sml">438</sup></a> They
looked, as we have previously remarked, to the relations of

which supplied such an explanation of the universe might
well be excused from explaining, also, that existence of objects,
which is distinct from the existence of all their qualities and
properties. The Pythagorean doctrine of numbers might have
been combined with the doctrine of atoms, and the combination
might have led to results worthy of notice. But, so far as we
are aware, no such combination was attempted, and perhaps
we of the present day are only just beginning to perceive,
through the disclosures of chemistry and crystallography, the

<p>Pythagoras had long devoted his intellectual adoration to
the lofty idea of <i>order</i>, which seemed to reveal itself to his
mind, as the presiding genius of the serene and silent world.
He had, from his youth, dwelt with delight upon the eternal relations
of space, and determinate form, and number, in which
the very idea of <i>proportion</i> seems to find its first and immediate
development, and without the latter of which (number), all
proportion is absolutely inconceivable. To this ardent genius,
whose inventive energies were daily adding new and surprising
contributions to the sum of discoverable relations, it at length
began to appear as if the whole secret of the universe was hidden
in these mysterious correspondences.</p>

<p>In making this extensive generalization, Pythagoras may, on
his known principles, be supposed to have reasoned as follows:
The mind of man perceives the relations of an eternal <i>order</i> in
the proportions of space, and form, and number. That mind
is, no doubt, a portion of the soul which animates and governs
the universe; for on what other supposition shall we account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="302">302</a></span>
for its internal principle of activity--the very principle which
characterizes the prime mover, and can scarce be ascribed to
an inferior nature? And on what other supposition are we to
explain the identity which subsists between the principles of
order, authenticated by the reason and the facts of order which
are found to exist in the forms and multiplicities around us, and
independent of us? Can this sameness be other than the
sameness of the internal and external principles of a common
nature? The proportions of the universe inhere in its divine
soul; they are indeed its very essence, or at least, its attributes.
The ideas or principles of Order which are implanted in the
human reason, must inhere in the Divine Reason, and must be
reflected in the visible world, which is its product. Man, then,
can boldly affirm the necessary harmony of the world, because
he has in his own mind a revelation which declares that the
world, in its real structure, must be the image and copy of that
divine <i>proportion</i> which he inwardly adores.<a id="footnotetag441" name="footnotetag441"></a>
<a href="#footnote441"><sup class="sml">441</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote441"
name="footnote441"><b>Footnote 441: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag441">
(return) </a> It is an opinion which goes as far back as the time of Plato, and even
Pythagoras, and has ever since been widely entertained, that beauty of <i>form</i>
consists in some sort of <i>proportion</i> or <i>harmony</i> which may admit of a mathematical
expression; and later and more scientific research is altogether in
its favor. It is now established that complementary colors, that is, colors
which when combined make up the full beam, are felt to be beautiful when
seen simultaneously; that is, the mind is made to delight in the unities of
nature. At the basis of music there are certain fixed ratios; and in poetry,
of every description, there are measures, and correspondencies. Pythagoras
has often been ridiculed for his doctrine of "the music of the spheres;"
and probably his doctrine was somewhat fanciful, but later science shows
that there is a harmony in all nature--in its forms, in its forces, and in its
motions. The highest unorganized and all organized objects take definite
forms which are regulated by mathematical laws. The forces of nature can be
estimated in numbers, and light and heat go in undulations, whilst the movements
of the great bodies in nature admit of a precise quantitative expression.
The harmonies of nature in respect of color, of number, of form, and
of time are forcibly exhibited in "Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation,"
by M'Cosh.</blockquote>

<p>Again, the world is assuredly <i>perfect</i>, as being the sensible
image and copy of the Divinity, the outward and multiple development
of the Eternal Unity. It must, therefore, when
thoroughly known and properly interpreted, answer to all which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="303" >303</a></span>
we can conceive as perfect; that is, it must be regulated by laws,
of which we have the highest principles in those first and elementary
properties of numbers which stand next to <i>unity</i>.
"The world is then, through all its departments, <i>a living arithmetic
in its development, a realized geometry in its repose</i>." It is
a κόσµος (for the word is purely Pythagorean)--the expression
of <i>harmony</i>, the manifestation, to sense, of everlasting <i>order</i>.</p>

<p>Though Pythagoras found in geometry the fitting initiative
for abstract speculation, it is remarkable that he himself preferred
to constitute the science of Numbers as the true representative
of the laws of the universe. The reason appears to
be this: that though geometry speaks indeed of eternal truths,
yet when the notion of symmetry and proportion is introduced,
it is often necessary to insist, in preference, upon the properties
of numbers. Hence, though the universe displays the geometry
of its Constructor or Animator, yet nature was eminently defined
as the µίµησις τῶν ἀριθµῶν--the imitation of numbers.</p>

<p>The key to all the Pythagorean dogmas, then, seems to be
the general formula of <i>unity in multiplicity</i>:--unity either
evolving itself into multiplicity, or unity discovered as pervading
multiplicity. The principle of all things, the same principle
which in this philosophy, as in others, was customarily called
<i>Deity</i>, is the primitive unit from which all proceeds in the accordant
relations of the universal scheme. Into the sensible
world of multitude, the all-pervading Unity has infused his own
ineffable nature; he has impressed his own image upon that
world which is to represent him in the sphere of sense and
man. What, then, is that which is at once single and multiple,
identical and diversified--which we perceive as the combination
of a thousand elements, yet as the expression of a single
spirit--which is a chaos to the sense, a cosmos to the reason?
What is it but harmony--proportion--the one governing the
many, the many lost in the one? The world is therefore a
<i>harmony</i> in innumerable degrees, from the most complicated
to the most simple: it is now a Triad, combining the Monad
and the Duad, and partaking of the nature of both; now a Tetrad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="304" >304</a></span>
the form of perfection; now a Decad, which, in combining
the four former, involves, in its mystic nature, all the possible
accordances of the universe.<a id="footnotetag442" name="footnotetag442"></a>
<a href="#footnote442"><sup class="sml">442</sup></a></p>

<p>The psychology of the Pythagoreans was greatly modified
by their physical, and still more, by their moral tenets. The
soul was ἀριθµὸς ἑαυτὸν κινῶν--a self-moving number or Monad,
the copy (as we have seen) of that Infinite Monad which unfolds
from its own incomprehensible essence all the relations of the
universe. This soul has three elements, Reason (νοῦς), Intelligence
(φρήν), and Passion (θυµός). The two last, man has in
common with brutes, the first is his grand and peculiar characteristic.
It has, hence, been argued that Pythagoras could not
have held the doctrine of "transmigration." This clear separation
of man from the brute, by this signal endowment of reason,
which is sempiternal, seems a refutation of those who charge
him with the doctrine.</p>

<p>In the department of morals, the legislator of Crotona found
his appropriate sphere. In his use of numerical notation, moral
good was essential unity--evil, essential plurality and division.
In the fixed truths of mathematical abstractions he found the
exemplars of social and personal virtue. The rule or law of
all morality is resemblance to God; that is, the return of number
to its root, to unity,<a id="footnotetag443" name="footnotetag443"></a>
<a href="#footnote443"><sup class="sml">443</sup></a> and virtue is thus a harmony.</p>

the Decad as the cosmos, or harmonious whole.</blockquote>

<p>Thus have we, in Pythagoras, the dawn of an <i>Idealist</i> school;
for mathematics are founded upon abstractions, and there is
consequently an intimate connection between mathematics and
idealism. The relations of space, and number, and determinate
form, are, like the relations of cause and effect, of phenomena
and substance, perceptible <i>only in thought</i>; and the mind which
has been disciplined to abstract thought by the study of
mathematics, is prepared and disposed for purely metaphysical
studies. "The looking into mathematical learning is a kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="305">305</a></span>
of prelude to the contemplation of real being."<a id="footnotetag444" name="footnotetag444"></a>
<a href="#footnote444"><sup class="sml">444</sup></a> Therefore
Plato inscribed over the door of his academy, "Let none but
Geometricians enter here." To the mind thus disciplined in
abstract thinking, the conceptions and ideas of reason have
equal authority, sometimes even superior authority, to the perceptions
of sense.</p>

<p>Now if the testimony of both reason and sense, as given in
consciousness, is accepted as of equal authority, and each faculty
is regarded as, within its own sphere, a source of real, valid
knowledge, then a consistent and harmonious system of <i>Natural
Realism</i> or <i>Natural Dualism</i> will be the result. If the testimony
of sense is questioned and distrusted, and the mind is
denied any immediate knowledge of the sensible world, and
yet the existence of an external world is maintained by various
hypotheses and reasonings, the consequence will be a species of
<i>Hypothetical Dualism</i> or <i>Cosmothetic Idealism</i>. But if the affirmations
of reason, as to the unity of the cosmos, are alone accepted,
and the evidence of the senses, as to the variety and
multiplicity of the world, is entirely disregarded, then we have
a system of <i>Absolute Idealism</i>. Pythagoras regarded the harmony
which pervades the diversified phenomena of the outer
world as a manifestation of the unity of its eternal principle, or
as the perpetual evolution of that unity, and the consequent
<i>tendency</i> of his system was to depreciate the <i>sensible</i>. Following
out this tendency, the Eleatics first neglected, and finally
denied the variety of the universe--denied the real existence
of the external world, and asserted an absolute <i>metaphysical</i>
unity.</p>

<p><i>Xenophanes of Colophon</i>, in Ionia (B.C. 616-516), was the
founder of this celebrated school of Elea. He left Ionia, and
arrived in Italy about the same time as Pythagoras, bringing
with him to Italy his Ionian tendencies; he there amalgamated
them with Pythagorean speculations.</p>

<p>Pythagoras had succeeded in fixing the attention of his
countrymen on the harmony which pervades the material world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="306" >306</a></span>
and had taught them to regard that harmony as the manifestation
of the intelligence, and unity, and perfection of its eternal
principle. Struck with this idea of harmony and of unity,
Xenophanes, who was a poet, a rhapsodist, and therefore by
native tendency, rather than by intellectual discipline, an Idealist,
begins already to attach more importance to <i>unity</i> than
multiplicity in his philosophy of nature. He regards the testimony
of reason as of more authority than the testimony of
sense; "and he holds badly enough the balance between the
unity of the Pythagoreans and the variety which Heraclitus
and the Ionians had alone considered."<a id="footnotetag445" name="footnotetag445"></a>
<a href="#footnote445"><sup class="sml">445</sup></a></p>

<p>We are not, however, to suppose that Xenophanes denied
entirely the existence of <i>plurality</i>. "The great Rhapsodist of
Truth" was guided by the spontaneous intuitions of his mind
(which seemed to partake of the character of an inspiration),
to a clearer vision of the truth than were his successors of the
same school by their discursive reasonings. "The One" of
Xenophanes was clearly distinguished from the outward universe
(τὰ πολλά) on the one hand, and from the "<i>non-ens</i>" on
the other. It was his disciple, Parmenides, who imagined the
logical necessity of identifying plurality with the "<i>non-ens</i>" and
thus denying all immediate cognition of the phenomenal world.
The compactness and logical coherence of the system of Parmenides
seems to have had a peculiar charm for the Grecian
mind, and to have diverted the eyes of antiquity from the views
of the more earnest and devout Xenophanes, whose opinions
were too often confounded with those of his successors of the
Eleatic school. "Accordingly we find that Xenophanes has
obtained credit for much that is, exclusively, the property of
Parmenides and Zeno, in particular for denying plurality, and
for identifying God with the universe."<a id="footnotetag446" name="footnotetag446"></a>

And yet, regardless of these explicit utterances, Lewes cautions

meant a Personal God; and he asserts that his Monotheism
was Pantheism. A doctrine, however, which ascribes
to the Divine Being moral as well as intellectual supremacy,
which acknowledges an outward world distinct from Him, and
which represents Him as causing the changes in that universe
by the acts of an intelligent volition, can only by a strange perversion
of language be called pantheism.</p>

<p><i>Parmenides of Elea</i> (born B.C. 536) was the philosopher who
framed the psychological opinions of the Idealist school into a
precise and comprehensive system. He was the first carefully
to distinguish between <i>Truth</i> (ἀλήθειαν) and <i>Opinion</i> (δοξαν)--between
ideas obtained through the reason and the simple perceptions
of sense. Assuming that reason and sense are the
only sources of knowledge, he held that they furnish the mind
with two distinct classes of cognitions--one variable, fleeting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="308" >308</a></span>
and uncertain; the other immutable, necessary, and eternal.
Sense is dependent on the variable organization of the individual,
and therefore its evidence is changeable, uncertain, and
nothing but a mere "<i>seeming</i>." Reason is the same in all individuals,
and therefore its evidence is constant, real, and true.
Philosophy is, therefore, divided into two branches--<i>Physics</i>
and <i>Metaphysics</i>; one, a science of absolute knowledge; the
other, a science of mere appearances. The first science, Physics,
is pronounced illusory and uncertain; the latter, Metaphysics,
is infallible and immutable.<a id="footnotetag450" name="footnotetag450"></a>
<a href="#footnote450"><sup class="sml">450</sup></a></p>

<p>Proceeding on these principles, he rejects the dualistic system
of the universe, and boldly declared that all essences are
fundamentally <i>one</i>--that, in fact, there is no real plurality, and
that all the diversity which "appears" is merely presented
under a peculiar aesthetic or sensible law. The senses, it is
true, teach us that there are "many things," but reason affirms
that, at bottom, there exists only "the one." Whatever, therefore,
manifests itself in the field of sense is merely illusory--the
mental representation of a phenomenal world, which to experience
seems diversified, but which reason can not possibly
admit to be other than "immovable" and "one." There is
but one Being in the universe, eternal, immovable, absolute;
and of this unconditioned being all phenomenal existences,
whether material or mental, are but the attributes and modes.
Hence the two great maxims of the Eleatic school, derived
from Parmenides--τὰ πάντα ἕν, "<i>The All is One</i>" and τὸ αὐτὸ
νοεῖν τε καὶ εἶναι (Idem est cogitare atque esse), "<i>Thought and
Being are identical.</i>" The last remarkable dictum is the fundamental
principle of the modern pantheistic doctrine of "absolute
identity" as taught by Schelling and Hegel.<a id="footnotetag451" name="footnotetag451"></a>

<p>This organon, however, Zeno used very imperfectly. In his
hands it was simply the "reductio ad absurdum" of opposing
opinions as the means of sustaining the tenets of his own sect.
Parmenides had asserted, on <i>à priori</i> grounds, the existence of
"the One." Zeno would prove by his dialectic the non-existence
of "the many." His grand position was that all phenomena,
all that appears to sense, is but a <i>modification</i> of the
absolute One. And he displays a vast amount of dialectic
subtilty in the effort to prove that all "appearances" are unreal,
and that all movement and change is a mere "seeming"--not
a reality. What men call motion is only a name given
to a series of conditions, each of which, considered separately,
is rest. "Rest is force resistant; motion is force triumphant."<a id="footnotetag457" name="footnotetag457"></a>

<p>Aristotle assures us that Zeno, "by his one Ens, which neither
was moved nor movable, meaneth God." And he also informs
us that "Zeno endeavored to demonstrate that there is
but one God, from the idea which all men have of him, as that
which is the best, supremest, most powerful of all, or an absolutely
perfect being" ("De Xenophane, Zenone, et Gorgia").<a id="footnotetag459" name="footnotetag459"></a>

<p>With Zeno we close our survey of the second grand line of
independent inquiry by which philosophy sought to solve the
problem of the universe. The reader will be struck with the
resemblance which subsists between the history of its development
and that of the modern Idealist school. Pythagoras was
the Descartes, Parmenides the Spinoza, and Zeno the Hegel
of the Italian school.</p>

<p>In this survey of the speculations of the pre-Socratic schools
of philosophy, we have followed the course of two opposite
streams of thought which had their common origin in one fundamental
principle or law of the human mind--the <i>intuition of
unity</i>--"or the desire to comprehend all the facts of the universe
in a single formula, and consummate all conditional
knowledge in the unity of unconditioned existence." The history
of this tendency is, in fact, the history of all philosophy.
"The end of all philosophy," says Plato, "is the intuition of
unity." "All knowledge," said the Platonists, "is the gathering
up into one."<a id="footnotetag460" name="footnotetag460"></a>

<p>Starting from this fundamental idea, <i>that, beneath the endless
flux and change of the visible universe, there must be a permanent
principle of unity</i>, we have seen developed two opposite schools
of speculative thought. As the traveller, standing on the ridges
of the Andes, may see the head-waters of the great South
American rivers mingling in one, so the student of philosophy,
standing on the elevated plane of analytic thought, may discover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="311" >311</a></span>
in this fundamental principle, the common source of the
two great systems of speculative thought which divided the
ancient world. Here are the head-waters of the sensational
and the idealist schools. The Ionian school started its course
of inquiry in the direction of <i>sense</i>; it occupied itself solely
with the phenomena of the external world, and it sought this
principle of unity in a <i>physical</i> element. The Italian school
started its course of inquiry in the direction of <i>reason</i>; it occupied
itself chiefly with rational conceptions or <i>à priori</i> ideas,
and it sought this principle of unity in purely <i>metaphysical</i>
being. And just as the Amazon and La Plata sweep on, in
opposite directions, until they reach the extremities of the continent,
so these two opposite streams of thought rush onward,
by the force of a logical necessity, until they terminate in the
two Unitarian systems of <i>Absolute Materialism</i> and <i>Absolute
Idealism</i>, and, in their theological aspects, in a pantheism
which, on the one hand, identifies God with matter, or, on the
other hand, swallows up the universe in God.</p>

<p>The radical error of both these systems is at once apparent.
The testimony of the primary faculties of the mind was not
regarded as each, within its sphere, final and decisive. The
duality of consciousness was not accepted in all its integrity;
one school rejected the testimony of reason, the other denied
the veracity of the senses, and both prepared the way for the
<i>skepticism</i> of the Sophists.</p>

<p>We must not, however, lose sight of the fact that there were
some philosophers of the pre-Socratic school, as Anaxagoras
and Empedocles, who recognized the partial and exclusive
character of both these systems, and sought, by a method
which Cousin would designate as Eclecticism, to combine the
element of truth contained in each.</p>

<p><i>Anaxagoras of Clazomencœ</i> (B.C. 500-428) added to the Ionian
philosophy of a material element or elements the Italian
idea of a <i>spirit</i> distinct from, and independent of the world,
which has within itself the principle of a spontaneous activity--Νοῦς
 αὐτοκρατής, and which is the first cause of motion in the
universe--ἀρχὴ τῆς κινήσεως.<a id="footnotetag461" name="footnotetag461"></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="312">312</a></span>

<p>In his physical theory, Anaxagoras was an Atomist. Instead
of one element, he declared that the elements or first principles
were numerous, or even infinite. No point in space is unoccupied
by these atoms, which are infinitely divisible. He imagined
that, in nature, there are as many kinds of principles as
there are species of compound bodies, and that the peculiar
form of the primary particles of which any body is composed
is the same with the qualities of the compound body itself.
This was the celebrated doctrine of <i>Homœomeria</i>, of which Lucretius
furnishes a luminous account in his philosophic poem
"De Natura Rerum"--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<a href="#footnote462"><sup class="sml">462</sup></a></p>
</div></div>

<p>These primary particles were regarded by Anaxagoras as eternal;
because he held the dogma, peculiar to all the Ionians,
that nothing can be really created or annihilated (de nihilo nihil,
in nihilum nil posse reverti). But he saw, nevertheless,
that the simple existence of "<i>inert</i>" matter, even from eternity,
could not explain the motion and the harmony of the material
world. Hence he saw the necessity of another power--<i>the
power of Intelligence</i>. "All things were in chaos; then came
Intelligence and introduced Order."<a id="footnotetag463" name="footnotetag463"></a>
<a href="#footnote463"><sup class="sml">463</sup></a></p>

<p>Anaxagoras, unlike the pantheistic speculators of the Ionian
school, rigidly separated the Supreme Intelligence from the
material universe. The Νοῦς of Anaxagoras is a principle,
infinite, independent (αὺτοκρατές), omnipresent (ἐν παντὶ παντὸς
µοίοα ἔνον), the subtilest and purest of things (λεπτότατον πάντων
χρηµάτων καὶ καθαρώτατον); and incapable of mixture with aught
besides; it is also omniscient (πάντα ἔγνω), and unchangeable
(πᾶς ὁµοῖός ἐστι).--Simplicius, in "Arist. Phys." i. 33.<a id="footnotetag464" name="footnotetag464"></a>

<p>Thus did Anaxagoras bridge the chasm between the Ionian
and the Italian schools. He accepted both doctrines with
some modifications. He believed in the real existence of the
phenomenal world, and he also believed in the real existence
of "The Infinite Mind," whose Intelligence and Omnipotence
were manifested in the laws and relations which pervade the
world. He proclaimed the existence of the Infinite Intelligence
("the ONE"), who was the Architect and Governor of the
Infinite Matter ("the MANY").</p>

<p>On the question as to the origin and certainty of human
knowledge, Anaxagoras differed both from the Ionians and the
Eleatics. Neither the sense alone, nor the reason alone, were
for him a ground of certitude. He held that reason (λόγος)
was the regulative faculty of the mind, as the Νοῦς, or Supreme
Intelligence, was the regulative power of the universe. And
he admitted that the senses were veracious in their reports;
but they reported only in regard to phenomena. The senses,
then, perceive <i>phenomena</i>, but it is the reason alone which recognizes
<i>noumena</i>, that is, the reason perceives being in and
through phenomena, substance in and through qualities; an
anticipation of the fundamental principle of modern psychology--"<i>that
every power or substance in existence is knowable to us,
so far only, as we know its phenomena</i>." Thus, again, does he
bridge the chasm that separates between the Sensationalist
and the Idealist. The Ionians relied solely on the intuitions
of sense; the Eleatics accepted only the apperceptions of pure
reason; he accepted the testimony of both, and in the synthesis
of subject and object--the union of an element supplied by
sensation, and an element supplied by reason, he found real,
certain knowledge.</p>

<p>The harmony which the doctrine of Anaxagoras introduced
into the philosophy of Athens, soon attracted attention and
multiplied disciples. He was teaching when Socrates arrived
in Athens, and the latter attended his school. The influence
which the doctrine of Anaxagoras exerted upon the mind of
Socrates (leading him to recognize Intelligence as the cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="314" >314</a></span>
of order and special adaptation in the universe),<a id="footnotetag465" name="footnotetag465"></a>
<a href="#footnote465"><sup class="sml">465</sup></a> and also upon

<p>We have devoted a much larger space than we originally
designed to the ante-Socratic schools--quite out of proportion,
indeed, with that we shall be able to appropriate to their successors.
But inasmuch as all the great primary problems of
thought, which are subsequently discussed by Plato and Aristotle,
were started, and received, at least, typical answers in
those schools, we can not hope to understand Plato, or Aristotle,

<p class="mid"><b>II. THE SOCRATIC SCHOOL.</b></p>

<p>The first cycle of philosophy was now complete. That form
of Grecian speculative thought which, during the first period of
its development, was a philosophy of nature, had reached its
maturity; it had sought "the first principles of all things" in the
study of external nature, and had signally failed. In this pursuit
of first principles as the basis of a true and certain knowledge
of the system of the universe, the two leading schools had
been carried to opposite poles of thought. One had asserted
that <i>experience</i> alone, the other, that <i>reason</i> alone was the
sole criterion of truth. As the last consequence of this imperfect
method, Leucippus had denied the existence of "the
one," and Zeno had denied the existence of "the many."
The Ionian school, in Democritus, had landed in Materialism;
the Italian, in Parmenides, had ended in Pantheism; and, as
the necessary result of this partial and defective method of inquiry,
which ended in doubt and contradiction, a spirit of general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="315" >315</a></span>
skepticism was generated in the Athenian mind. If doubt
be cast upon the veracity of the primary cognitive faculties of
the mind, the flood-gates of universal skepticism are opened.
If the senses are pronounced to be mendacious and illusory in
their reports regarding external phenomena, and if the intuitions
of the reason, in regard to the ground and cause of phenomena,
are delusive, then we have no ground of certitude. If
one faculty is unveracious and unreliable, how can we determine
that the other is not equally so? There is, then, no such
thing as universal and necessary truth. Truth is variable and
uncertain, as the variable opinion of each individual.</p>

<p>The Sophists, who belonged to no particular school, laid
hold on the elements of skepticism contained in both the pre-Socratic
schools of philosophy, and they declared that "the
σοφία" was not only unattainable, but that no relative degree
of it was possible for the human faculties.<a id="footnotetag468" name="footnotetag468"></a>
<a href="#footnote468"><sup class="sml">468</sup></a> Protagoras of Abdera
accepted the doctrine of Heraclitus, that thought is identical
with sensation, and limited by it; he therefore declared
that there is no criterion of truth, and <i>Man is the measure of
all things</i>.<a id="footnotetag469" name="footnotetag469"></a>
<a href="#footnote469"><sup class="sml">469</sup></a> Sextus Empiricus gives the psychological opinions
of Protagoras with remarkable explicitness. "Matter is in a
perpetual flux, whilst it undergoes augmentations and losses;
the senses also are modified according to the age and disposition
of the body. He said, also, that the reason of all phenomena
resides in matter as substrata, so that matter, in itself,
might be whatever it appeared to each. But men have different
perceptions at different periods, according to the changes
in the things perceived.... Man is, therefore, the criterion
of that which exists; all that is perceived by him exists; <i>that
which is perceived by no man does not exist</i>."<a id="footnotetag470" name="footnotetag470"></a>

<p>There were others who laid hold on the weapons which Zeno
had prepared to their hands. He had asserted that all the objects
of sense were mere phantoms--delusive and transitory.

prove that "change" meant "permanence," and "motion"
meant "rest."<a id="footnotetag473" name="footnotetag473"></a>
<a href="#footnote473"><sup class="sml">473</sup></a> Words may, therefore, have the most opposite
and contradictory meanings; and all language and all opinion
may, by such a process, be rendered uncertain. One opinion
is, consequently, for the individual, just as good as another; and
all opinions are equally true and untrue. It was nevertheless
desirable, for the good of society, that there should be some
agreement, and that, for a time at least, certain opinions should
prevail; and if philosophy had failed to secure this agreement,
rhetoric, at least, was effectual; and, with the Sophist,
rhetoric was "the art of making the worst appear the better
reason." All wisdom was now confined to a species of "word
jugglery," which in Athens was dignified as "the art of disputation."</p>

<p>SOCRATES (B.C. 469-399), the grand central figure in the
group of ancient philosophers, arrived in Athens in the midst
of this general skepticism. He had an invincible faith in truth.
"He made her the mistress of his soul, and with patient labor,
and unwearied energy, did his great and noble soul toil after
perfect communion with her." He was disappointed and dissatisfied
with the results that had been reached by the methods
of his predecessors, and he was convinced that by these methods
the problem of the universe could not be solved. He
therefore turned away from physical inquiries, and devoted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="317" >317</a></span>
whole attention to the study of the human mind, its fundamental
beliefs, ideas, and laws. If he can not penetrate the
mysteries of the outer world, he will turn his attention to the
world within. He will "know himself," and find within himself
the reason, and ground, and law of all existence. There
he discovered certain truths which can not possibly be questioned.
He felt he had within his own heart a faithful monitor--a
<i>conscience</i>, which he regarded as the voice of God.<a id="footnotetag474" name="footnotetag474"></a>
<a href="#footnote474"><sup class="sml">474</sup></a> He
believed "he had a divine teacher with him at all times.

<a href="#footnote475"><sup class="sml">475</sup></a> In
himself, therefore, he sought that ground of certitude which

<p>Truth has a rational, <i>à priori</i> foundation in the constitution

reason which are the copies of those archetypal ideas which

therefore, now is--<i>What are these fundamental</i> IDEAS <i>which

has said, "the service which Socrates rendered tο philosophy
consisted not so much in the truths arrived at <i>as in
the</i> METHOD <i>by which truth is sought</i>." As Bacon inaugurated
a new method in physical inquiry, so Socrates inaugurated a
new method in metaphysical inquiry.</p>

<p>What, then, was this <i>new method</i>? It was no other than the
<i>inductive</i> method applied to the facts of consciousness. This
method is thus defined by Aristotle: "Induction is the process
from particulars to generals;" that is, it is the process of
discovering laws from facts, causes from effects, being from
phenomena. But how is this process of induction conducted?
By observing and enumerating the real facts which are presented
in consciousness, by noting their relations of resemblance
or difference, and by classifying these facts by the aid of these
relations. In other words, it is <i>analysis</i> applied to the phenomena
of mind.<a id="footnotetag477" name="footnotetag477"></a>
<a href="#footnote477"><sup class="sml">477</sup></a> Now Socrates gave this method of psychological
analysis to Greek philosophy. There are two things
of which Socrates must justly be regarded as the author,--the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="319" >319</a></span>
<i>inductive reasoning</i> and <i>abstract definition</i>.<a id="footnotetag478" name="footnotetag478"></a>
<a href="#footnote478"><sup class="sml">478</sup></a> We readily grant
that Socrates employed this method imperfectly, for methods
are the last things perfected in science; but still, the Socratic
movement was a vast movement in the right direction.</p>

<p>In what are usually regarded as the purely Socratic dialogues,<a id="footnotetag479" name="footnotetag479"></a>
<a href="#footnote479"><sup class="sml">479</sup></a>
Plato evidently designs to exhibit this method of Socrates.
They proceed continually on the firm conviction that
there is a standard or criterion of truth in the reason of man,
and that, by <i>reflection</i>, man can apprehend and recognize the
truth. To awaken this power of reflection; to compel men to
analyze their language and their thoughts; to lead them from
the particular and the contingent, to the universal and the necessary;
and to teach them to test their opinions by the inward
standard of truth, was the aim of Socrates. These dialogues
are a picture of the conversations of Socrates. They are literally
an education of the thinking faculty. Their purpose is to
discipline men to think for themselves, rather than to furnish
opinions for them. In many of these dialogues Socrates affirms
nothing. After producing many arguments, and examining a
question on all sides, he leaves it undetermined. At the close
of the dialogue he is as far from a declaration of opinions as at
the commencement. His grand effort, like that of Bacon's, is
to furnish men a correct method of inquiry, rather than to apply
that method and give them results.</p>

<p>We must not, however, from thence conclude that Socrates
did not himself attain any definite conclusions, or reach any
specific and valuable results. When, in reply to his friends who
reported the answer of the oracle of Delphi, that "Socrates was
the wisest of men," he said, "he supposed the oracle declared
him wise <i>because he knew nothing</i>," he did not mean that true
knowledge was unattainable, for his whole life had been spent
in efforts to attain it. He simply indicates the disposition of
mind which is most befitting and most helpful to the seeker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="320" >320</a></span>
after truth. He must be conscious of his own ignorance. He
must not exalt himself. He must not put his own conceits in
the way of the thing he would know. He must have an open
eye, a single purpose, an honest mind, to prepare him to receive
light when it comes. And that there is light, that there is a
source whence light comes, he avowed in every word and act.</p>

<p>Socrates unquestionably believed in one Supreme God, the
immaterial, infinite Governor of all. He cherished that instinctive,
spontaneous faith in God and his Providence which
is the universal faith of the human heart. He saw this faith
revealed in the religious sentiments of all nations, and in the
tendency to worship so universally characteristic of humanity.<a id="footnotetag480" name="footnotetag480"></a>
<a href="#footnote480"><sup class="sml">480</sup></a>
He appealed to the consciousness of absolute dependence--the
persuasion, wrought by God in the minds of all men, that
"He is able to make men happy or miserable," and the consequent
sense of obligation which teaches man he ought to obey
God. And he regarded with some degree of affectionate tenderness
the common sentiment of his countrymen, that the Divine
Government was conducted through the ministry of subordinate
deities or generated gods. But he sought earnestly to
prevent the presence of these subordinate agents from intercepting
the clear view of the Supreme God.</p>

<p>The faith of Socrates was not, however, grounded on mere
feeling and sentiment. He endeavored to place the knowledge
of God on a rational basis. We can not read the arguments
he employed without being convinced that he anticipated all
the subsequent writers on Natural Theology in his treatment
of the argument from <i>special ends</i> or <i>final causes</i>. We venture
to abridge the account which is given by Xenophon of the conversation
with Aristodemus:<a id="footnotetag481" name="footnotetag481"></a>

<p>"I will now relate the manner in which I once heard Socrates
discoursing with Aristodemus concerning the Deity; for,
observing that he never prayed nor sacrificed to the gods, but,
on the contrary, ridiculed those who did, he said to him:</p>

<p>"'Tell me, Aristodemus, is there any man you admire on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="321">321</a></span>
account of his merits? Aristodemus having answered, 'Many,--'Name
some of them, I pray you,' said Socrates. 'I admire,'
said Aristodemus, 'Homer for his Epic poetry, Melanippides
for his dithyrambics, Sophocles for his tragedy, Polycletus for
statuary, and Zeuxis for painting.'</p>

<p>"'But which seemed to you most worthy of admiration,
Aristodemus--the artist who forms images void of motion and
intelligence, or one who has skill to produce animals that are
endued, not only with activity, but understanding?'</p>

<p>"'The latter, there can be no doubt,' replied Aristodemus,
'provided the production was not the effect of chance, but of
wisdom and contrivance.'</p>

<p>"'But since there are many things, some of which we can
easily see the use of, while we can not say of others to what
purpose they are produced, which of these, Aristodemus, do
you suppose the work of wisdom?'</p>

<p>"'It would seem the most reasonable to affirm it of those
whose fitness and utility are so evidently apparent,' answered
Aristodemus.</p>

<p>"'But it is evidently apparent that He who, at the beginning,
made man, endued him with senses because they were good for
him; eyes wherewith to behold what is visible, and ears to hear
whatever was heard; for, say, Aristodemus, to what purpose
should odor be prepared, if the sense of smelling had been denied
or why the distinction of bitter or sweet, of savory or unsavory,
unless a palate had been likewise given, conveniently
placed to arbitrate between them and proclaim the difference?
Is not that Providence, Aristodemus, in a most eminent manner
conspicuous, which, because the eye of a man is so delicate
in its contexture, hath therefore prepared eyelids like doors
whereby to secure it, which extend of themselves whenever it
is needful, and again close when sleep approaches? Are not
these eyelids provided, as it were, with a fence on the edge of
them to keep off the wind and guard the eye? Even the eyebrow
itself is not without its office, but, as a penthouse, is prepared
to turn off the sweat, which falling from the forehead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="322" >322</a></span>
might enter and annoy that no less tender than astonishing
part of us. Is it not to be admired that the ears should take
in sounds of every sort, and yet are not too much filled with
them? That the fore teeth of the animal should be formed in
such a manner as is evidently best for cutting, and those on the
side for grinding it to pieces? That the mouth, through which
this food is conveyed, should be placed so near the nose and
eyes as to prevent the passing unnoticed whatever is unfit for
nourishment?... And canst thou still doubt, Aristodemus,
whether a <i>disposition of parts like this should be a work of chance,
or of wisdom and contrivance</i>?'</p>

<p>"'I have no longer any doubt,' replied Aristodemus; 'and,
indeed, the more I consider it, the more evident it appears to
me that man must be the masterpiece of some great Artificer,
carrying along with it infinite marks of the love and favor of
Him who hath thus formed it.'</p>

<p>"'But, further (unless thou desirest to ask me questions),
seeing, Aristodemus, thou thyself art conscious of reason and
intelligence, supposest thou there is no intelligence elsewhere?
Thou knowest thy body to be a small part of that wide-extended
earth thou everywhere beholdest; the moisture contained in it
thou also knowest to be a portion of that mighty mass of waters
whereof seas themselves are but a part, while the rest of the
elements contribute out of their abundance to thy formation.
It is the <i>soul</i>, then, alone, that intellectual part of us, which is
come to thee by some lucky chance, from I know not where. If
so, there is no intelligence elsewhere; and we must be forced to
confess that this stupendous universe, with all the various bodies
contained therein--equally amazing, whether we consider
their magnitude or number, whatever their use, whatever their
order--all have been produced by chance, not by intelligence!'</p>

<p>"'It is with difficulty that I can suppose otherwise,' returned
Aristodemus; 'for I behold none of those gods whom you
speak of as framing and governing the world; whereas I see
the artists when at their work here among us.'</p>

<p>"'Neither yet seest thou thy soul, Aristodemus, which, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="323" >323</a></span>
most assuredly governs thy body; although it may well
seem, by thy manner of talking, that it is chance and not reason
which governs thee.'</p>

<p>"'I do not despise the gods,' said Aristodemus; 'on the
contrary, I conceive so highly of their excellency, as to suppose
they stand in no need of me or of my services.'</p>

<p>"'Thou mistakest the matter,' Aristodemus, 'the great magnificence
they have shown in their care of thee, so much the
more honor and service thou owest them.'</p>

<p>"'Be assured,' said Aristodemus, 'if I once could persuade
myself the gods take care of man, I should want no monitor to
remind me of my duty.'</p>

<p>"'And canst thou doubt, Aristodemus, if the gods take care
of man? Hath not the glorious privilege of walking upright
been alone bestowed on him, whereby he may with the better
advantage survey what is around him, contemplate with more
ease those splendid objects which are above, and avoid the numerous
ills and inconveniences which would otherwise befall
him? Other animals, indeed, they have provided with feet;
but to man they have also given hands, with which he can form
many things for use, and make himself happier than creatures
of any other kind. A tongue hath been bestowed on every
other animal; but what animal, except man, hath the power of
forming words with it whereby to explain his thoughts and
make them intelligible to others? But it is not with respect to
the body alone that the gods have shown themselves bountiful
to man. Their most excellent gift is that of a soul they have
infused into him, which so far surpasses what is elsewhere to be
found; for by what animal except man is even the existence
of the gods discovered, who have produced and still uphold in
such regular order this beautiful and stupendous frame of the
universe? What other creature is to be found that can serve
and adore them?... In thee, Aristodemus, has been joined
to a wonderful soul a body no less wonderful; and sayest thou,
after this, the gods take no thought for me? What wouldst
thou, then, more to convince thee of their care?'</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="324" >324</a></span>

<p>"'I would they should send and inform me,' said Aristodemus,
'what things I ought or ought not to do, in like manner
as thou sayest they frequently do to thee.'"</p>

<p>In reply, Socrates shows that the revelations of God which
are made in nature, in history, in consciousness, and by oracles,
are made <i>for</i> all men and <i>to</i> all men. He then concludes
with these remarkable words: "As, therefore, amongst men we
make best trial of the affection and gratitude of our neighbor
by showing him kindness, and make discovery of his wisdom
by consulting him in our distress, do thou, in like manner, behave
towards the gods; and if thou wouldst experience what
their wisdom and their love, render thyself deserving of some
of those divine secrets which may not be penetrated by man,
and are imparted to those alone who consult, who adore, and
who obey the Deity. Then shalt thou, my Aristodemus, understand
<i>there is a Being whose eye passes through all nature, and
whose ear is open to every sound; extended to all places, extending
through all time; and whose bounty and care can know no other
bounds than those fixed by his own creation</i>".<a id="footnotetag482" name="footnotetag482"></a>

<p>Socrates was no less earnest in his belief in the immortality
of the soul, and a state of future retribution. He had reverently
listened to the intuitions of his own soul--the instinctive
longings and aspirations of his own heart, as a revelation from
God. He felt that all the powers and susceptibilities of his inward
nature were in conscious adaptation to the idea of immortality,
and that its realization was the appropriate destiny
of man. He was convinced that a future life was needed to
avenge the wrongs and reverse the unjust judgments of the
present life;<a id="footnotetag483" name="footnotetag483"></a>
<a href="#footnote483"><sup class="sml">483</sup></a> needed that virtue may receive its meet reward,
and the course of Providence may have its amplest vindication.
He saw this faith reflected in the universal convictions of mankind,
and the "common traditions" of all ages.<a id="footnotetag484" name="footnotetag484"></a>
<a href="#footnote484"><sup class="sml">484</sup></a> No one refers

<a href="#footnote485"><sup class="sml">485</sup></a> He

<p>Whilst, then, Socrates was not the first to teach the doctrine
of immortality, because no one could be said to have first <i>discovered</i>
it any more than to have first discovered the existence
of a God, he was certainly the first to place it upon a philosophic
basis. The Phædo presents the doctrine and the <i>reasoning</i>
by which Socrates had elevated his mind above the fear
of death. Some of the arguments may be purely Platonic, the
argument especially grounded on "ideas;" still, as a whole, it
must be regarded as a tolerably correct presentation of the
manner in which Socrates would prove the immortality of the
soul.</p>

<p>In <i>Ethics</i>, Socrates was pre-eminently himself. The systematic
resolution of the whole theory of society into the elementary
principle of natural law, was peculiar to him. <i>Justice</i> was
the cardinal principle which must lie at the foundation of all
good government. The word σοφια--<i>wisdom</i>--included all
excellency in personal morals, whether as manifested (reflectively)
in the conduct of one's self, or (socially) towards others.
And <i>Happiness</i>, in its purity and perfection, can only be found
in virtuous action.<a id="footnotetag486" name="footnotetag486"></a>

<p>Socrates left nothing behind him that could with propriety
be called a <i>school</i>. His chief glory is that he inaugurated a
new <i>method</i> of inquiry, which, in Plato and Aristotle, we shall
see applied. He gave a new and vital impulse to human
thought, which endured for ages; "and he left, as an inheritance
for humanity, the example of a heroic life devoted wholly
to the pursuit of truth, and crowned with martyrdom."</p>

<h3>PLATO.</h3>

<p>We have seen that the advent of Socrates marks a new
era in the history of speculative thought. Greek philosophy,
which at first was a philosophy of nature, now changes
its direction, its character, and its method, and becomes a philosophy
of mind. This, of course, does not mean that now it
had mind alone for its object; on the contrary, it tended, as
indeed philosophy must always tend, to the conception of a
rational ideal or <i>intellectual system of the universe</i>. It started
from the phenomena of mind, began with the study of human
thought, and it made the knowledge of mind, of its ideas and
laws, the basis of a higher philosophy, which should interpret
all nature. In other words, it proceeded from psychology,
through dialectics, to ontology.<a id="footnotetag487" name="footnotetag487"></a>

<p>This new movement we have designated in general terms
as the <i>Socratic School</i>. Not that we are to suppose that, in any
technical sense, Socrates founded <i>a</i> school. The Academy,
the Lyceum, the Stoa, and the Garden, were each the chosen
resort of distinct philosophic sects, the locality of separate
schools; but Athens itself, the whole city, was the scene of
the studies, the conversations, and the labors of Socrates. He
wandered through the streets absorbed in thought. Sometimes
he stood still for hours lost in profoundest meditation; at other
times he might be seen in the market-place, surrounded by a
crowd of Athenians, eagerly discussing the great questions of
the day.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="327">327</a></span>

<p>Socrates, then, was not, in the usual sense of the word, a
teacher. He is not to be found in the Stoa or the Grove, with
official aspect, expounding a system of doctrine. He is "the
garrulous oddity" of the streets, putting the most searching
and perplexing questions to every bystander, and making every
man conscious of his ignorance. He delivered no lectures;
he simply talked. He wrote no books; he only argued: and
what is usually styled his school must be understood as embracing
those who attended him in public as listeners and
admirers, and who caught his spirit, adopted his philosophic
<i>method</i>, and, in after life, elaborated and systematized the ideas
they had gathered from him.</p>

<p>Among the regular or the occasional hearers of Socrates
were many who were little addicted to philosophic speculation.
Some were warriors, as Nicias and Laches; some statesmen,
as Critias and Critobulus; some were politicians, in the worst
sense of that word, as Glaucon; and some were young men of
fashion, as Euthydemus and Alcibiades. These were all alike
delighted with his inimitable irony, his versatility of genius, his
charming modes of conversation, his adroitness of reply; and
they were compelled to confess the wisdom and justness of his
opinions, and to admire the purity and goodness of his life.
The magic power which he wielded, even over men of dissolute
character, is strikingly depicted by Alcibiades in his speech at
"the Banquet."<a id="footnotetag488" name="footnotetag488"></a>
<a href="#footnote488"><sup class="sml">488</sup></a> Of these listeners, however, we can not now
speak. Our business is with those only who imbibed his philosophic
spirit, and became the future teachers of philosophy.
And even of those who, as Euclid of Megara, and Antisthenes
the Cynic, and Aristippus of Cyrenaica, borrowed somewhat
from the dialectic of Socrates, we shall say nothing. They left
no lasting impression upon the current of philosophic thought,
because their systems were too partial, and narrow, and fragmentary.
It is in Plato and Aristotle that the true development
of the Socratic philosophy is to be sought, and in Plato
chiefly, as the disciple and friend of Socrates.</p>

<p>Plato (B.C. 430-347) was pre-eminently the pupil of Socrates.
He came to Socrates when he was but twenty years of
age, and remained with him to the day of his death.</p>

<p>Diogenes Laertius reports the story of Socrates having
dreamed he found an unfledged cygnet on his knee. In a few
moments it became winged and flew away, uttering a sweet
sound. The next day a young man came to him who was said
to reckon Solon among his near ancestors, and who looked,
through him, to Codrus and the god Poseidon. That young
man was Plato, and Socrates pronounced him to be the bird
he had seen in his dream.<a id="footnotetag489" name="footnotetag489"></a>

(return) </a> Diogenes Laertius, "Lives of the Philosophers," bk. iii. ch. vii.</blockquote>

<p>Some have supposed that this old tradition intimates that
Plato departed from the method of his master--he became
fledged and flew away into the air. But we know that Plato
did not desert his master whilst he was living, and there is no
evidence that he abandoned his method after he was dead.
He was the best expounder and the most rigid observer of the
Socratic "organon." The influence of Socrates upon the philosophy
of Plato is everywhere discernible. Plato had been
taught by Socrates, that beyond the world of sense there is a
world of eternal truth, seen by the eye of reason alone. He
had also learned from him that the eye of reason is purified
and strengthened by <i>reflection</i>, and that to reflect is to observe,
and analyze, and define, and classify the facts of consciousness.
Self-reflection, then, he had been taught to regard as the key
of real knowledge. By a completer induction, a more careful
and exact analysis, and a more accurate definition, he carried
this philosophic method forward towards maturity. He sought
to solve the problem of <i>being</i> by the principles revealed in his
own consciousness, and in the <i>ultimate ideas of the reason</i> to
find the foundation of all real knowledge, of all truth, and of
all certitude.</p>

<p>Plato was admirably fitted for these sublime investigations
by the possession of those moral qualities which were so prominent
in the character of his master. He had that same deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="329" >329</a></span>
seriousness of spirit, that earnestness and rectitude of purpose,
that longing after truth, that inward sympathy with, and reverence
for justice, and purity, and goodness, which dwelt in the
heart of Socrates, and which constrained him to believe in their
reality and permanence. He could not endure the thought
that all ideas of right were arbitrary and factitious, that all
knowledge was unreal, that truth was a delusion, and certainty
a dream. The world of sense might be fleeting and delusive,
but the voice of reason and conscience would not mislead the
upright man. The opinions of individual men might vary, but
the universal consciousness of the race could not prevaricate.
However conflicting the opinions of men concerning beautiful
things, right actions, and good sentiments, Plato was persuaded
there are ideas of Order, and Right, and Good, which are universal,
unchangeable, and eternal. Untruth, injustice, and
wrong may endure for a day or two, perhaps for a century or
two, but they can not always last; they must perish. The <i>just</i>
thing and the <i>true</i> thing are the only enduring things; these
are eternal. Plato had a sublime conviction that his mission
was to draw the Athenian mind away from the fleeting, the
transitory, and the uncertain, and lead them to the contemplation
of an Eternal Truth, an Eternal Justice, an Eternal Beauty,
all proceeding from and united in an Eternal Being--the ultimate
ἀγαθόν--<i>the Supremely Good</i>. The knowledge of this
"Supreme Good" he regarded as the highest science.<a id="footnotetag490" name="footnotetag490"></a>

<p>Added to these moral qualifications, Plato had the further
qualification of a comprehensive knowledge of all that had
been achieved by his predecessors. In this regard he had
enjoyed advantages superior to those of Socrates. Socrates
was deficient in erudition, properly so called. He had studied
men rather than books. His wisdom consisted in an extensive
<i>observation</i>, the results of which he had generalized with more
or less accuracy. A complete philosophic method demands
not only a knowledge of contemporaneous opinions and modes
of thought, but also a knowledge of the succession and development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="330" >330</a></span>
of thought in past ages. Its instrument is not simply
psychological analysis, but also historical analysis as a counterproof.<a id="footnotetag491" name="footnotetag491"></a>

the doctrines of the Ionian, Italian, and Eleatic schools.
Cratylus gave him special instruction in the theories of Heraclitus.<a id="footnotetag492" name="footnotetag492"></a>
<a href="#footnote492"><sup class="sml">492</sup></a>
He secured an intimate acquaintance with the lofty
speculations of Pythagoras, under Archytas of Tarentum, and
in the writings of Philolaus, whose books he is said to have
purchased. He studied the principles of Parmenides under
Hermogenes,<a id="footnotetag493" name="footnotetag493"></a>
<a href="#footnote493"><sup class="sml">493</sup></a> and he more than once speaks of Parmenides in

<a href="#footnote494"><sup class="sml">494</sup></a>
He studied mathematics under Theodoras, the most
eminent geometrician of his day. He travelled in Southern
Italy, in Sicily, and, in search of a deeper wisdom, he pursued
his course to Egypt.<a id="footnotetag495" name="footnotetag495"></a>
<a href="#footnote495"><sup class="sml">495</sup></a> Enriched by the fruits of all previous

<a href="#footnote496"><sup class="sml">496</sup></a> The knowledge he had derived from travel, from books,

the admiration and wonder of succeeding ages.<a id="footnotetag497" name="footnotetag497"></a>

<p>The question as to <i>the nature, the sources, and the validity of
human knowledge</i> had attracted general attention previous to
the time of Socrates and Plato. As the results of this protracted
controversy, the opinions of philosophers had finally
crystallized in two well-defined and opposite theories of knowledge.</p>

<p>1. That which reduced all knowledge to the accidental and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="331">331</a></span>
passively receptive quality of the organs of sense and which
asserted, as its fundamental maxim, that "<i>Science consists in</i>
αἴσθησις--<i>sensation</i>."<a id="footnotetag498" name="footnotetag498"></a>
<a href="#footnote498"><sup class="sml">498</sup></a></p>

<p>This doctrine had its foundation in the physical philosophy
of Heraclitus. He had taught that all things are in a perpetual
flux and change. "Motion gives the appearance of existence
and of generation." "Nothing <i>is</i>, but is always a <i>becoming"</i><a id="footnotetag499" name="footnotetag499"></a>
<a href="#footnote499"><sup class="sml">499</sup></a>
Material substances are perpetually losing their identity, and
there is no permanent essence or being to be found. Hence
Protagoras inferred that truth must vary with the ever-varying
sensations of the individual. "Man (the individual) is the
measure of all things." Knowledge is a purely relative thing,
and every man's opinion is truth for him.<a id="footnotetag500" name="footnotetag500"></a>
<a href="#footnote500"><sup class="sml">500</sup></a> The law of right,
as exemplified in the dominion of a party, is the law of the
strongest; fluctuating with the accidents of power, and never
attaining a permanent being. "Whatever a city enacts as appearing
just to itself, this also is just to the city that enacts it,
so long as it continues in force."<a id="footnotetag501" name="footnotetag501"></a>
<a href="#footnote501"><sup class="sml">501</sup></a> "The just, then, is nothing
else but that which is expedient for the strongest."<a id="footnotetag502" name="footnotetag502"></a>

<p>2. The second theory is that which denies the existence (except
as phantasms, images, or mere illusions of the mind) of
the whole of sensible phenomena, and refers all knowledge to
the <i>rational apperception of unity</i> (τὸ ἔν) <i>or the One</i>.</p>

<p>This was the doctrine of the later Eleatics. The world of
sense was, to Parmenides and Zeno, a blank negation, the <i>non
ens</i>. The identity of thought and existence was the fundamental
principle of their philosophy.</p>

<p>This theory, therefore, denied to man any valid knowledge of
the external world.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="332" >332</a></span>

<p>It will at once be apparent to the intelligent reader that the
direct and natural result of both these theories<a id="footnotetag504" name="footnotetag504"></a>
<a href="#footnote504"><sup class="sml">504</sup></a> of knowledge
was a tendency to universal skepticism. A spirit of utter indifference
to truth and righteousness was the prevailing spirit
of Athenian society. That spirit is strikingly exhibited in the
speech of Callicles, "the shrewd man of the world," in "Gorgias"
(§85, 86). Is this new to our ears?" My dear Socrates,
you talk of <i>law</i>. Now the laws, in my judgment, are just
the work of the weakest and most numerous; in framing them
they never thought but of themselves and their own interests;
they never approve or censure except in reference to <i>this.</i>
Hence it is that the cant arises that tyranny is improper and
unjust, and to struggle for eminence, guilt. Unable to rise
themselves, of course they would wish to preach liberty and
equality. But nature proclaims the law of the stronger....
We surround our children from their infancy with preposterous
prejudices about liberty and justice. The man of sense tramples
on such impositions, and shows what Nature's justice
is.... I confess, Socrates, philosophy is a highly amusing
study--in moderation, and for boys. But protracted too long,
it becomes a perfect plague. Your philosopher is a complete
novice in the life <i>comme il faut</i>.... I like very well to see a
child babble and stammer; there is even a grace about it when
it becomes his age. But to see a man continue the prattle of
the child, is absurd. Just so with your philosophy." The consequence
of this prevalent spirit of universal skepticism was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="333" >333</a></span>
general laxity of morals. The Aleibiades, of the "<i>Symposium</i>,"
is the ideal representative of the young aristocracy of Athens.
Such was the condition of society generally, and such the degeneracy
of even the Government itself, that Plato impressively
declares "that God alone could save the young men of his age
from ruin."<a id="footnotetag505" name="footnotetag505"></a>

(return) </a> Between these two extreme theories there were offered two, apparently
less extravagant, accounts of the nature and limits of human knowledge--one
declaring that "<i>Science</i>(real knowledge) <i>consists in right opinion</i>" (δόξα
ἀληθής), but having no further basis in the reason of man ("Theæstetus,"
§ 108); and the other affirming that "<i>Science is right opinion with logical explication
or definition</i>" (µετὰ λόχου), ("Theætetus," § 139). A close examination
will, however, convince us that these are but modifications of the
sensational theory. The latter forcibly remind us of the system of Locke,
who adds "reflection" to "sensation," but still maintains that all on "simple
ideas" are obtained from without, and that these are the only material
upon which reflection can be exercised. Thus the human mind has no criterion
of truth within itself, no elements of knowledge which are connatural
and inborn.</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the grand, the vital, the most urgent question for
his times, as indeed for all times, was, <i>What is Truth? What
is Right</i>? In the midst of all this variableness and uncertainty
of human opinion, is there no ground of certainty? Amid all
the fluctuations and changes around us and within us, is there
nothing that is immutable and permanent? Have we no ultimate
standard of Right? Is there no criterion of Truth?
Plato believed most confidently there was such a criterion and
standard. He had learned from Socrates, his master, to cherish
an unwavering faith in the existence of an Eternal Truth, an
Eternal Order, an Eternal Good, the knowledge of which is
essential to the perfection and happiness of man, and which
knowledge must therefore be presumed to be attainable by
man. Henceforth, therefore, the ceaseless effort of Plato's life
is to attain a standard (κριτήριον)<a id="footnotetag506" name="footnotetag506"></a>
<a href="#footnote506"><sup class="sml">506</sup></a>--a CRITERION OF TRUTH.</p>

name="footnote506"><b>Footnote 506: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag506">
(return) </a> "Theætetus," § 89.</blockquote>

<p>At the outset of his philosophic studies, Plato had derived
from Socrates an important principle, which became the guide
of all his subsequent inquiries. He had learned from him that
the criterion of truth must be no longer sought amid the ever-changing
phenomena of the "sensible world." This had been
attempted by the philosophers of the Ionian school, and ended
in failure and defeat. It must therefore be sought in the metaphenomenal--the
"intelligible world;" that is, it must be sought
in the apperceptions of the reason, and not in opinions founded
on sensation. In other words, he must look <i>within</i>. Here, by
reflection, he could recognize, dimly and imperfectly at first,
but increasing gradually in clearness and distinctness, two
classes of cognitions, having essentially distinct and opposite
characteristics. He found one class that was complex (σνγκεγυµένον),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="334">334</a></span>
changeable (θάτερον), contingent and relative (τὰ προς
τι σχέσιν ἔχοντα); the other, simple (κεχωρισµένον), unchangeable
(ἀκίνητον), constant (ταὐτόν), permanent (τὸ ὂν ἀει), and
absolute (ἀνυπόθετον = ἁπλοῦν). One class that may be questioned,
the other admitting of no question, because self-evident
and necessary, and therefore compelling belief. One class
grounded on sense-perception, the other conceived by reason
alone. But whilst the reason recognizes, it does not create
them. They are not particular and individual, but universal.
They belong not to the man, but to the race.</p>

<p>He found, then, that there are in all minds certain "principles"
which are fundamental--principles which lie at the basis
of all our cognitions of the objective world, and which, as
"mental laws," determine all our forms of thought; and principles,
too, which have this marvellous and undeniable character,
that they are encountered in the most common experiences,
and, at the same time, instead of being circumscribed within
the limits of experience, transcend and govern it--principles
which are <i>universal</i> in the midst of particular phenomena--<i>necessary,</i>
though mingled with things contingent--to our eyes
<i>infinite</i> and <i>absolute</i>, even when appearing in us the relative and
finite beings that we are.<a id="footnotetag507" name="footnotetag507"></a>
<a href="#footnote507"><sup class="sml">507</sup></a> These first or fundamental principles

<p>In attempting to present to the reader an adequate representation
of the Platonic Ideas, we shall be under the necessity
of anticipating some of the results of his Dialectical method
before we have expounded that method. And, further, in
order that it may be properly appreciated by the modern student,
we shall avail ourselves of the lights which modern psychology,
faithful to the method of Plato, has thrown upon the
subject. Whilst, however, we admit that modern psychology
has succeeded in giving more definiteness and precision to the
"doctrine of Ideas," we shall find that all that is fundamentally
valuable and true was present to the mind of Plato. Whatever
superiority the "Spiritual" philosophy of to-day may have over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="335">335</a></span>
the philosophy of past ages, it has attained that superiority by
its adherence to the principles and method of Plato.</p>

<p>In order to the completeness of our preliminary exposition
of the Platonic doctrine of Ideas, we shall conditionally assume,
as a natural and legitimate hypothesis, the doctrine so
earnestly asserted by Plato, that the visible universe, at least
in its present form, is an <i>effect</i> which must have had a <i>cause</i>,<a id="footnotetag508" name="footnotetag508"></a>
<a href="#footnote508"><sup class="sml">508</sup></a>
and that the Order, and Beauty, and Excellence of the universe
are the result of the presence and operation of a "regulating
Intelligence"--a <i>Supreme Mind</i>.<a id="footnotetag509" name="footnotetag509"></a>
<a href="#footnote509"><sup class="sml">509</sup></a> Now that, anterior to the
creation of the universe, there must have existed in the Eternal
Mind certain fundamental principles of Order, Right, and Good,
will not be denied. Every conceivable <i>form</i>, every possible
<i>relation</i>, every principle of <i>right</i>, must have been eternally present
to the Divine thought. As pure intelligence, the Deity
must have always been self-conscious--must have known himself
as substance and cause, as the Infinite and Perfect. If
then the Divine Energy is put forth in creative acts, that energy
must obey those eternal principles of Order, Right, and Good.
If the Deity operate at all, he must operate rightly, wisely, and
well. The created universe must be an <i>image</i>, in the sphere
of sense, of the ideas which inhere in the reason of the great
First Cause.</p>

<p>"Let us declare," says Plato, "with what <i>motive</i> the Creator
hath formed nature and the universe. He was <i>good</i>, and in
the good no manner of envy can, on any subject, possibly subsist.
Exempt from envy, he had wished that all things should,
as far as possible, <i>resemble himself</i>.... It was not, and is not
to be allowed for the Supremely Good to do any thing except
what is most <i>excellent</i> (κάλλιστον)--most <i>fair</i>, most <i>beautiful</i>."<a id="footnotetag510" name="footnotetag510"></a>
<a href="#footnote510"><sup class="sml">510</sup></a>
Therefore, argues Plato, "inasmuch as the world is the most
beautiful of things, and its artificer the best of causes, it is evident
that the Creator and Father of the universe looked to the
<i>Eternal Model</i> (παράδειγµα), pattern, or plan,"<a id="footnotetag511" name="footnotetag511"></a>
<a href="#footnote511"><sup class="sml">511</sup></a> which lay in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="336" >336</a></span>
own mind. And thus this one, only-generated universe, is the

<p>And then, furthermore, if this Supreme Intelligence, this
Eternal Mind, shall create another <i>mind</i>, it must, in a still
higher degree, resemble him. Inasmuch as it is a rational
nature, it must, in a peculiar sense, partake of the Divine characteristics.
"The soul," says Plato, "is that which most partakes
of the <i>Divine</i>"<a id="footnotetag513" name="footnotetag513"></a>
<a href="#footnote513"><sup class="sml">513</sup></a> The soul must, therefore, have native
<i>ideas</i> and sentiments which correlate it with the Divine original.
The ideas of substance and cause, of unity and identity,
of the infinite and perfect, must be mirrored there. As it is
the "offspring of God,"<a id="footnotetag514" name="footnotetag514"></a>
<a href="#footnote514"><sup class="sml">514</sup></a> it must bear some traces and lineaments
of its Divine parentage. That soul must be configured
and correlated to those principles of Order, Right, and Good
which dwell in the Eternal Mind. And because it has within
itself the same ideas and laws, according to which the great
Architect built the universe, therefore it is capable of knowing,
and, in some degree, of comprehending, the intellectual system
of the universe. It apprehends the external world by a light
which the reason supplies. It interprets nature according to
principles and laws which God has inwrought within the very
essence of the soul. "That which imparts truth to knowable
things, and gives the knower his power of knowing truth, is the
<i>idea of the good</i>, and you are to conceive of this as the source
of knowledge and of truth."<a id="footnotetag515" name="footnotetag515"></a>

<p>And now we are prepared to form a clear conception of the
Platonic doctrine of Ideas. Viewed in their relation to the
Eternal Reason, as giving the primordial thought and law of
all being, these principles are simply εἴδη αὐτὰ καθ᾽ αὑτά--<i>ideas
in themselves</i>--the essential qualities or attributes of Him who
is the supreme and ultimate Cause of all existence. When regarded
as before the Divine imagination, giving definite forms
and relations, they are the τύποι, the παραδείγµατα--<i>the types</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="337" >337</a></span>
<i>models, patterns, ideals</i> according to which the universe was
fashioned. Contemplated in their actual embodiment in the
laws, and typical forms of the material world, they are εἰκόνες--<i>images</i>
of the eternal perfections of God. The world of sense
pictures the world of reason by a participation (µέθεξις) of the
ideas. And viewed as interwoven in the very texture and
framework of the soul, they are ὁµοιώµατα--copies of the Divine
Ideas which are the primordial laws of knowing, thinking, and
reasoning. Ideas are thus the nexus of relation between God
and the visible universe, and between the human and the
Divine reason.<a id="footnotetag516" name="footnotetag516"></a>
<a href="#footnote516"><sup class="sml">516</sup></a> There is something divine in the world, and
in the human soul, namely, <i>the eternal laws and reasons of
things</i>, mingled with the endless diversity and change of sensible
phenomena. These ideas are "the light of the intelligible
world;" they render the invisible world of real Being perceptible
to the reason of man. "Light is the offspring of the Good,
which the Good has produced in his own likeness. Light in
the visible world is what the <i>idea of the Good</i> is in the intelligible
world. And this offspring of the Good--light--has the
same relation to vision and visible things which the Good has
to intellect and intelligible things."<a id="footnotetag517" name="footnotetag517"></a>

<p><i>Science</i> is, then, according to Plato, <i>the knowledge of universal,
necessary, unchangeable, and eternal ideas</i>. The simple cognition
of the concrete phenomena of the universe is not regarded by
him as <i>real</i> knowledge. "Science, or real knowledge, belongs
to <i>Being</i>, and ignorance to <i>non</i>-Being." Whilst that which is
conversant only "with that which partakes of both--of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="338" >338</a></span>

absolute righteousness. And so of other ideas. But they who
look at these ideas--permanent and unchangeable ideas--these
men <i>really know</i>."<a id="footnotetag519" name="footnotetag519"></a>
<a href="#footnote519"><sup class="sml">519</sup></a> Those are the true philosophers alone who
love the sight of truth, and who have attained to the vision of
the eternal order, and righteousness, and beauty, and goodness

OF REAL KNOWLEDGE.</p>

<p>Plato, in the "Theætetus," puts this question by the interlocutor
Socrates, "What is Science (᾽Επιστήµη) or positive
knowledge?"<a id="footnotetag520" name="footnotetag520"></a>
<a href="#footnote520"><sup class="sml">520</sup></a> Theætetus essays a variety of answers, such as,
"Science is sensation," "Science is right judgment or opinion,"
"Science is right opinion with logical definition." These,
in the estimation of the Platonic Socrates, are all unsatisfactory
and inadequate. But after you have toiled to the end of
this remarkable discussion, in which Socrates demolishes all
the then received theories of knowledge, he gives you no answer
of his own. He abruptly closes the discussion by naïvely
remarking that, at any rate, Theætetus will learn that he does
not understand the subject; and the ground is now cleared for
an original investigation.</p>

<p>This investigation is resumed in the "Republic." This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="339">339</a></span>
greatest work of Plato's was designed not only to exhibit a
scheme of Polity, and present a system of Ethics, but also, at
least in its digressions, to propound a system of Metaphysics
more complete and solid than had yet appeared. The discussion
as to the <i>powers</i> or <i>faculties</i> by which we obtain knowledge,
the <i>method</i> or <i>process</i> by which real knowledge is attained, and
the ultimate <i>objects</i> or <i>ontological grounds</i> of all real knowledge,
commences at § 18, book v., and extends to the end of book vii.</p>

<p>That we may reach a comprehensive view of this "sublimest
of sciences," we shall find it necessary to consider--</p>

<p>1st. <i>What are the powers or faculties by which we obtain
knowledge, and what are the limits and degrees of human knowledge?</i></p>

<p>2d. <i>What is the method in which, or the processes and laws according
to which, the mind operates in obtaining knowledge?</i></p>

<p>3d. <i>What are the ultimate results attained by this method?
what are the objective and ontological grounds of all real knowledge?</i></p>

<p>The answer to the first question will give the PLATONIC
PSYCHOLOGY; the answer to the second will exhibit the PLATONIC
DIALECTIC; the answer to the last will reveal the PLATONIC
ONTOLOGY.</p>

<p class="mid"><b>I. PLATONIC PSYCHOLOGY.</b></p>

<p>Every successful inquiry as to the reality and validity of
human knowledge must commence by clearly determining, by
rigid analysis, what are the actual phenomena presented in
consciousness, what are the powers or faculties supposed by
these phenomena, and what reliance are we to place upon the
testimony of these faculties? And, especially, if it be asserted
that there is a science of absolute Reality, of ultimate and essential
Being, then the most important and vital question is,
By what power do we cognize real Being? through what faculty
do we obtain the knowledge of that which absolutely <i>is</i>? If
by sensation we only obtain the knowledge of the fleeting and
the transitory, "<i>the becoming</i>" how do we attain to the knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="340" >340</a></span>
of the unchangeable and permanent, "the <i>Being</i>?" Have
we a faculty of universal, necessary, and eternal principles?
Have we a faculty, an interior eye which beholds "<i>the intelligible</i>,"
ideal, spiritual world, as the eye of sense beholds the visible
or "<i>sensible world</i>?"<a id="footnotetag521" name="footnotetag521"></a>
<a href="#footnote521"><sup class="sml">521</sup></a></p>

<p>Plato commences this inquiry by first defining his understanding
of the word δύναµις--<i>power</i> or <i>faculty</i>. "We will say
<i>faculties</i> (δυνάµεις) are a certain kind of real existences by
which we can do whatever we are able (<i>e.g.</i>, to know), as there
are powers by which every thing does what it does: the eye
has a <i>power</i> of seeing; the ear has a <i>power</i> of hearing. But
these powers (of which I now speak) have no color or figure to
which I can so refer that I can distinguish one power from
another. <i>In order to make such distinction, I must look at the
power itself, and see what it is, and what it does. In that way
I discern the power of each thing, and that is the same power
which produces the same effect, and that is a different power which
produces a different effect</i>."<a id="footnotetag522" name="footnotetag522"></a>
<a href="#footnote522"><sup class="sml">522</sup></a> That which is employed about,
and accomplishes one and the same purpose, this Plato calls
a <i>faculty</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that our first conceptions (<i>i.e.</i>, first in the
order of time) are of the mingled, the concrete (τὸ συγκεχυµένον),
"the multiplicity of things to which the multitude ascribe
beauty, etc.<a id="footnotetag523" name="footnotetag523"></a>
<a href="#footnote523"><sup class="sml">523</sup></a> The mind "contemplates what is great and

<a href="#footnote524"><sup class="sml">524</sup></a>
Prior to the discipline of <i>reflection</i>, men are curious about
mere sights and sounds, love beautiful voices, beautiful colors,
beautiful forms, but their intelligence can not see, can not embrace,
the essential nature of the Beautiful itself.<a id="footnotetag525" name="footnotetag525"></a>
<a href="#footnote525"><sup class="sml">525</sup></a> Man's condition

<span class="pagenum"><a name="341" >341</a></span>

<p>Primarily nothing is given in the abstract (τὸ κεγωρισµένον), but
every thing in the concrete. The primary faculties of the
mind enter into action spontaneously and simultaneously; all
our primary notions are consequently synthetic. When reflection
is applied to this primary totality of consciousness, that
is, when we analyze our notions, we find them composed of
diverse and opposite elements, some of which are variable,
contingent, individual, and relative, others are permanent, unchangeable,
universal, necessary, and absolute. Now these
elements, so diverse, so opposite, can not have been obtained
from the same source; they must be supplied by separate
powers. "Can any man with common sense reduce under

<p>These primitive intuitions--the simple perceptions of sense,
and the <i>à priori</i> intuitions of the reason, which constitute the
elements of all our complex notions, have essentially <i>diverse
objects</i>--the sensible or ectypal world, seen by the eye and
touched by the hand, which Plato calls δοξαστήν--<i>the subject of
opinion</i>; and the noetic or archetypal world, perceived by reason,
and which he calls διανοητικήν--<i>the subject of rational intuition
or science</i>. "It is plain," therefore, argues Plato, "that
<i>opinion</i> is a different thing from <i>science</i>. They must, therefore,
have a different <i>faculty</i> in reference to a different object--science
as regards that which <i>is</i>, so as to know the nature of real
<i>being</i>--opinion as regards that which can not be said absolutely
to be, or not to be. That which is known and that
which is opined can not possibly be the same,... since they
are naturally faculties of different things, and both of them are
faculties--<i>opinion</i> and <i>science</i>, and each of them different from
the other."<a id="footnotetag529" name="footnotetag529"></a>
<a href="#footnote529"><sup class="sml">529</sup></a> Here then are two grand divisions of the mental
powers--a faculty of apprehending universal and necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="342">342</a></span>
Truth, of intuitively beholding absolute Reality, and a faculty

<p>According to the scheme of Plato, these two general divisions
of the mental powers are capable of a further subdivision.
He says: Consider that there are two kinds of things, the <i>intelligible</i>
and the <i>visible</i>; two different regions, the intelligible
world and the sensible world. Now take a line divided into
two equal segments to represent these two regions, and again
divide each segment in the same ratio--both that of the visible
and that of the intelligible species. The parts of each segment
are to represent differences of clearness and indistinctness. In
the visible world the parts are <i>things</i> and <i>images</i>. By <i>images</i>
I mean shadows,<a id="footnotetag530" name="footnotetag530"></a>
<a href="#footnote530"><sup class="sml">530</sup></a> reflections in water and in polished bodies,
and all such like representations; and by <i>things</i> I mean that
of which images are resemblances, as animals, plants, and
things made by man.</p>

<p>You allow that this difference corresponds to the difference
of <i>knowledge</i> and <i>opinion</i>; and the <i>opinionable</i> is to the
<i>knowable</i> as the <i>image</i> to the <i>reality</i>.<a id="footnotetag531" name="footnotetag531"></a>
<a href="#footnote531"><sup class="sml">531</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote530"

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote531"
name="footnote531"><b>Footnote 531: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag531">
(return) </a> The analogy between the "images produced by reflections in water
and on polished surfaces" and "the images of external objects produced in
the mind by sensation" is more fully presented in the "Timæus," ch. 19.

<p>The eye is a light-bearer, "made of that part of elemental fire which
does not burn, but sheds a mild light, like the light of day.... When the
light of the day meets the light which beams from the eye, then light meets
like, and make a homogeneous body; the external light meeting the internal
light, in the direction in which the eye looks. And by this homogeneity
like feels like; and if this beam touches any object, or any object touches it,
it transmits the motions through the body to the soul, and produces that
sensation which we call <i>seeing</i>.... And if (in sleep) some of the strong
motions remain in some part of the frame, they produce within us likenesses
of external objects,... and thus give rise to dreams.... As to the images
produced by mirrors and by smooth surfaces, they are now easily explained,
for all such phenomena result from the mutual affinity of the external and
internal fires. The light that proceeds from the face (as an object of vision),
and the light that proceeds from the eye, become one continuous ray on the
smooth surface."</blockquote>

<p>Now we have to divide the segment which represents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="343" >343</a></span>
intelligible things in this way: The one part represents the knowledge
which the mind gets by using things as images--the other;
that which it has by dealing with the ideas themselves; the
one part that which it gets by reasoning downward from principles--the
other, the principles themselves; the one part,
truth which depends on hypotheses--the other, unhypothetical
or absolute truth.</p>

<p>Thus, to explain a problem in geometry, the geometers
make certain hypotheses (namely, definitions and postulates)
about numbers and angles, and the like, and reason from them--giving
no reason for their assumptions, but taking them as
evident to all; and, reasoning from them, they prove the propositions
which they have in view. And in such reasonings,
they use visible figures or diagrams--to reason about a square,
for instance, with its diagonals; but these reasonings are not
really about these visible figures, but about the mental figures,
and which they conceive in thought.</p>

<p>The diagrams which they draw, being visible, are the images
of thoughts which the geometer has in his mind, and these
images he uses in his reasoning. There may be images of
these images--shadows and reflections in water, as of other
visible things; but still these diagrams are only images of conceptions.</p>

<p>This, then, is <i>one</i> kind of intelligible things: <i>conceptions</i>--for
instance, geometrical conceptions of figures. But in dealing
with these the mind depends upon assumptions, and does not
ascend to first principles. It does not ascend above these assumptions,
but uses images borrowed from a lower region (the
visible world), these images being chosen so as to be as distinct
as may be.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="344">344</a></span>

<p>Now the <i>other</i> kind of intelligible things is this: that which
the <i>Reason</i> includes, in virtue of its power of reasoning, when
it regards the assumptions of the sciences as (what they are)
assumptions only, and uses them as occasions and starting-points,
that from these it may ascend to the <i>Absolute</i>, which
does not depend upon assumption, the origin of scientific truth.</p>

<p><i>The reason takes hold of this first principle of truth</i>, and availing
itself of all the connections and relations of this principle, it
proceeds to the conclusion--using no sensible image in doing
this, but contemplates the <i>idea alone</i>; and with these ideas the
process begins, goes on, and terminates.</p>

<p>"I apprehend," said Glaucon, "but not very clearly, for the
matter is somewhat abstruse. <i>You wish to prove that the knowledge
which by the reason, in an intuitive manner, we may acquire
of real existence and intelligible things is of a higher degree of certainty
than the knowledge which belongs to what are commonly
called the Sciences</i>. Such sciences, you say, have certain assumptions
for their basis; and these assumptions are by the
student of such sciences apprehended not by sense, but by a
mental operation--by conception.</p>

<p>"But inasmuch as such students ascend no higher than assumptions,
and do not go to the first principles of truth, they
do not seem to have true knowledge, intellectual insight, intuitive
reason, on the subjects of their reasonings, though the subjects
are intelligible things. And you call this habit and practice
of the geometers and others by the name of JUDGMENT
(διάνοια), not reason, or insight, or intuition--taking judgment
to be something between opinion, on the one side, and intuitive
reason, on the other.</p>

<p>"You have explained it well," said I. "And now consider
these four kinds of things we have spoken of, as corresponding
to four affections (or faculties) of the mind. INTUITIVE REASON
(νόησις), the highest; JUDGMENT (διάνοια)(or <i>discursive reason</i>),
the next; the third, BELIEF (πίστις); and the fourth, CONJECTURE,
or <i>guess</i> (εὶκασία); and arrange them in order, so that
they may be held to have more or less certainty, as their objects
have more or less truth."<a id="footnotetag532" name="footnotetag532"></a>
<a href="#footnote532"><sup class="sml">532</sup></a> The completeness, and even
accuracy of this classification of all the objects of human cognition,
and of the corresponding mental powers, will be seen
at once by studying the diagram proposed by Plato, as figured
on the opposite page.</p>

though this, of course, was necessarily a frequent matter of consideration.
Intellect was supposed by them to be cognizant of its own operations....

that it perceives."--Hamilton's "Metaphysics," vol. i. p. 198 (Eng. ed.).</blockquote>

<p>The conjoint action of these two powers results in what Plato
calls <i>opinion</i> (δόξα). "Opinion is the complication of memory
and sensation. For when we meet for the first time with a
thing perceptible by a sense, and a sensation is produced by it,
and from this sensation a memory, and we subsequently meet
again with the same thing perceived by a sense, we combine
the memory previously brought into action with the sensation
produced a second time, and we say within ourselves [this is]
Socrates, or a horse, or fire, or whatever thing there may be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="347" >347</a></span>
such a kind. Now this is called <i>opinion</i>, through our combining
the recollection brought previously into action with the sensation
recently produced. And when these, placed along each
other, agree, a true opinion is produced; but when they swerve
from each other, a false one."<a id="footnotetag538" name="footnotetag538"></a>
<a href="#footnote538"><sup class="sml">538</sup></a> The δόξα of Plato, therefore
answers to the experience, or the <i>empirical knowledge</i> of modern
philosophy, which is concerned only with appearances (phenomena),
and not with absolute realities, and can not be elevated
to the dignity of <i>science</i> or real knowledge.</p>

<p>We are not from hence to infer that Plato intended to deny
all reality whatever to the objects of sensible experience. These
transitory phenomena were not real existences, but they were
<i>images</i> of real existences. The world itself is but the image,
in the sphere of sense, of those ideas of Order, and Proportion,
and Harmony, which dwell in the Divine Intellect, and are
mirrored in the soul of man. "Time itself is a moving image
of Eternity."<a id="footnotetag539" name="footnotetag539"></a>
<a href="#footnote539"><sup class="sml">539</sup></a> But inasmuch as the immediate object of sense-perception
is a representative image generated in the vital organism,
and all empirical cognitions are mere "conjectures"
(εἰκασίαι) founded on representative images, they need to be
certified by a higher faculty, which immediately apprehends
real Being (τὸ ὄν). Of things, as they are in themselves, the
senses give us no knowledge; all that in sensation we are conscious
of is certain affections of the mind (πάθος); the existence
of self, or the perceiving subject, and a something external
to self, a perceived object, are revealed to us, not by the senses,
but by the reason.</p>

<p>3d. JUDGMENT (διάνοια, λόγος), <i>the Discursive Faculty, or the
Faculty of Relations</i>.--According to Plato, this faculty proceeds
on the assumption of certain principles as true, without inquiring
into their validity, and reasons, by deduction, to the conclusions
which necessarily flow from these principles. These assumptions
Plato calls hypotheses (ὑποθέσεις). But by hypotheses
he does not mean baseless assumptions--"mere theories--"but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="348">348</a></span>
things self-evident and "obvious to all;"<a id="footnotetag540" name="footnotetag540"></a>
<a href="#footnote540"><sup class="sml">540</sup></a> as for example, the
postulates and definitions of Geometry. "After laying down
hypotheses of the odd and even, and three kinds of angles
[right, acute, and obtuse], and figures [as the triangle, square,
circle, and the like], he <i>proceeds on them as known, and gives no
further reason about them</i>, and reasons downward from these
principles,"<a id="footnotetag541" name="footnotetag541"></a>

<p>All judgments are therefore founded on <i>relations</i>. To judge
is to compare two terms. "Every judgment has three parts:
the subject, or notion about which the judgment is; the predicate,
or notion with which the subject is compared; and the
copula, or nexus, which expresses the connection or relation between
them.<a id="footnotetag542" name="footnotetag542"></a>
<a href="#footnote542"><sup class="sml">542</sup></a> Every act of affirmative judgment asserts the
agreement of the predicate and subject; every act of negative
judgment asserts the predicate and subject do not agree. All
judgment is thus an attempt to reduce to unity two cognitions,
and reasoning (λογίζεσθαι) is simply the extension of this process.
When we look at two straight lines of equal length, we do not
merely think of them separately as <i>this</i> straight line, and <i>that</i>
straight line, but they are immediately connected together by a
comparison which takes place in the mind. We perceive that
these two lines are alike; they are of equal length, and they
are both straight; and the connection which is perceived as
existing between them is a <i>relation of sameness or identity.</i><a id="footnotetag543" name="footnotetag543"></a>
<a href="#footnote543"><sup class="sml">543</sup></a>
When we observe any change occurring in nature, as, for example,
the melting of wax in the presence of heat, the mind
recognizes a causal efficiency in the fire to produce that change,
and the relation now apprehended is a <i>relation of cause and effect</i><a id="footnotetag544" name="footnotetag544"></a>
<a href="#footnote544"><sup class="sml">544</sup></a>
But the fundamental principles, the necessary ideas
which lie at the basis of all the judgments (as the ideas of
space and time, of unity and identity, of substance and cause,
of the infinite and perfect) are not given by the judgment, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="349">349</a></span>

<p>4th. REASON (νοῦς)--<i>Intuitive Reason</i>, is the organ of self-evident,
necessary, and universal Truth. In an immediate,
direct, and intuitive manner, it takes hold on truth with absolute
certainty. The reason, through the medium of <i>ideas</i>, holds
communion with the world of real Being. These ideas are the
<i>light</i> which reveals the world of unseen realities, as the sun reveals
the world of sensible forms. "<i>The idea of the good</i> is the
<i>sun</i> of the Intelligible World; it sheds on objects the light of
truth, and gives to the soul that knows, the power of knowing."<a id="footnotetag547" name="footnotetag547"></a>
<a href="#footnote547"><sup class="sml">547</sup></a>
Under this light, the eye of reason apprehends the eternal
world of being as truly, yes more truly, than the eye of sense
apprehends the world of phenomena. This power the rational
soul possesses by virtue of its having a nature kindred, or even
homogeneous with the Divinity. It was "generated by the Divine
Father," and, like him, it is in a certain sense "<i>eternal</i>."<a id="footnotetag548" name="footnotetag548"></a>
<a href="#footnote548"><sup class="sml">548</sup></a>
Not that we are to understand Plato as teaching that the rational
soul had an independent and underived existence; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="350">350</a></span>
was created or "generated" in eternity,<a id="footnotetag549" name="footnotetag549"></a>
<a href="#footnote549"><sup class="sml">549</sup></a> and even now, in its
incorporate state, is not amenable to the conditions of time
and space, but, in a peculiar sense, dwells in eternity; and
therefore is capable of beholding eternal realities, and coming
into communion with absolute beauty, and goodness, and truth--that
is, with God, the <i>Absolute Being</i>.</p>

as a fixed state out of time existing contemporaneous with one in time</i>, to appreciate
the doctrine of Plato as stated above. If we regard his idea of
eternity as merely an indefinite extension of time, with a past, a present,
and a future, we can offer no rational interpretation of his doctrine of the
eternal nature of the rational essence of the soul. An eternal nature "generated"
in a "past" or "present" time is a contradiction. But that was
not Plato's conception of "eternity," as the reader will discover on perusing
the "Timæus" (ch. xiv.). "God resolved to create a moving image of eternity,
and out of that eternity which reposes in its own <i>unchangeable unity</i>
he framed an eternal image moving according to numerical succession,
which we call <i>Time</i>. Nothing can be more inaccurate than to apply the
terms, <i>past, present, future</i>, to real Being, which is immovable. Past and
future are expressions only suitable to generation which proceeds through
time." Time reposes on the bosom of eternity, as all bodies are in space.</blockquote>

<p>Thus the soul (ψυχή) as a composite nature is on one side
linked to the eternal world, its essence being generated of that
ineffable element which constitutes the real, the immutable,
and the permanent. It is a beam of the eternal Sun, a spark
of the Divinity, an emanation from God. On the other side it
is linked to the phenomenal or sensible world, its emotive part<a id="footnotetag550" name="footnotetag550"></a>
<a href="#footnote550"><sup class="sml">550</sup></a>
being formed of that which is relative and phenomenal. The
soul of man thus stands midway between the eternal and the
contingent, the real and the phenomenal, and as such, it is the
mediator between, and the interpreter of, both.</p>

<p>In the allegory of the "Chariot and Winged Steeds"<a id="footnotetag551" name="footnotetag551"></a>
<a href="#footnote551"><sup class="sml">551</sup></a> Plato
represents the lower or inferior part of man's nature as dragging
the soul down to the earth, and subjecting it to the slavery
and debasement of corporeal conditions. Out of these conditions
there arise numerous evils that disorder the mind and
becloud the reason, for evil is inherent to the condition of finite
and multiform being into which we have "fallen by our own
fault." The present earthly life is a fall and a punishment. The
soul is now dwelling in "the grave we call the body." In its
incorporate state, and previous to the discipline of education,
the rational element is "asleep." "Life is more of a dream
than a reality." Men are utterly the slaves of sense, the sport
of phantoms and illusions. We now resemble those "captives
chained in a subterraneous cave," so poetically described in the
seventh book of the "Republic;" their backs are turned to the
light, and consequently they see but the shadows of the objects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="351">351</a></span>
which pass behind them, and they "attribute to these shadows
a perfect reality." Their sojourn upon earth is thus a dark
imprisonment in the body, a dreamy exile from their proper
home. "Nevertheless these pale fugitive shadows suffice to
revive in us the reminiscence of that higher world we once inhabited,
if we have not absolutely given the reins to the impetuous
untamed horse which in Platonic symbolism represents
the emotive sensuous nature of man." The soul has some dim
and shadowy recollection of its ante-natal state of bliss, and
some instinctive and proleptic yearnings for its return.</p>

<p>Exiled from the true home of the spirit, imprisoned in the
body, disordered by passion, and beclouded by sense, the soul
has yet longings after that state of perfect knowledge, and
purity, and bliss, in which it was first created. Its affinities
are still on high. It yearns for a higher and nobler form of
life. It essays to rise, but its eye is darkened by sense, its
wings are besmeared by passion and lust; it is "borne downward,
until at length it falls upon and attaches itself to that
which is material and sensual," and it flounders and grovels
still amid the objects of sense.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ATHENS (<i>continued</i>.)</h3>

<h3>THE SOCRATIC SCHOOL (<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<h3>PLATO.</h3>

<h3>II. THE PLATONIC DIALECTIC.</h3>

<p>The Platonic Dialectic is the Science of Eternal and Immutable
Principles, and the <i>method</i> (ὄργανον) by which
these first principles are brought forward into the clear light
of consciousness. The student of Plato will have discovered
that he makes no distinction between logic and metaphysics.
These are closely united in the one science to which he gives
the name of "<i>Dialectic</i>" and which was at once the science of
the ideas and laws of the Reason, and of the mental process
by which the knowledge of Real Being is attained, and a
ground of absolute certainty is found. This science has, in
modern times, been called <i>Primordial</i> or <i>Transcendental Logic</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that Plato taught that the human reason is
originally in possession of fundamental and necessary ideas--the
copies of the archetypal ideas which dwell in the eternal
Reason; and that these ideas are the primordial laws of
thought--that is, they are the laws under which we conceive
of all objective things, and reason concerning all existence.
These ideas, he held, are not derived from sensation, neither
are they generalizations from experience, but they are inborn
and connatural. And, further, he entertained the belief, more,
however, as a reasonable hypothesis<a id="footnotetag554" name="footnotetag554"></a>
<a href="#footnote554"><sup class="sml">554</sup></a> than as a demonstrable
truth, that these standard principles were acquired by the soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="354">354</a></span>
in a pre-existent state in which it stood face to face with ideas
of eternal order, beauty, goodness, and truth.<a id="footnotetag555" name="footnotetag555"></a>
<a href="#footnote555"><sup class="sml">555</sup></a> "Journeying
with the Deity," the soul contemplated justice, wisdom, science--not
that science which is concerned with change, and
which appears under a different manifestation in different objects,
which we choose to call beings; but such science as is
in that which alone is indeed <i>being</i>.<a id="footnotetag556" name="footnotetag556"></a>
<a href="#footnote556"><sup class="sml">556</sup></a> Ideas, therefore, belong
to, and inhere in, that portion of the soul which is properly
οὐσία--<i>essence</i> or <i>being</i>; which had an existence anterior to
time, and even now has no relation to time, because it is now
in eternity--that is, in a sphere of being to which past, present,
and future can have no relation.<a id="footnotetag557" name="footnotetag557"></a>

<p>All knowledge of truth and reality is, therefore, according
to Plato, a REMINISCENCE (ἀνάµνησις)--a recovery of partially
forgotten ideas which the soul possessed in another state of
existence; and the <i>dialectic</i> of Plato is simply the effort, by apt
<i>interrogation</i>, to lead the mind to "<i>recollect</i>"<a id="footnotetag558" name="footnotetag558"></a>
<a href="#footnote558"><sup class="sml">558</sup></a> the truth which has
been formerly perceived by it, and is even now in the memory
though not in consciousness. An illustration of this method
is attempted in the "<i>Meno</i>" where Plato introduces Socrates
as making an experiment on the mind of an uneducated person.
Socrates puts a series of questions to a slave of Meno,
and at length elicits from the youth a right enunciation of a
geometrical truth. Socrates then points triumphantly to this
instance, and bids Meno observe that he had not taught the
youth any thing, but simply interrogated him as to his opinions,
whilst the youth had recalled the knowledge previously existing
in his own mind.<a id="footnotetag559" name="footnotetag559"></a>

(return) </a> "Meno," § 16-20. "Now for a person to recover knowledge himself
through himself, is not this to <i>recollect</i>."</blockquote>

<p>Now whilst we readily grant that the instance given in the
"<i>Meno</i>" does not sustain the inference of Plato that "the boy"
had learnt these geometrical truths "in eternity," and that they
had simply been brought forward into the view of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="355" >355</a></span>
consciousness by the "questioning" of Socrates, yet it certainly
does prove that <i>there are ideas or principles in the human reason
which are not derived from without--which are anterior to all
experience, and for the development of which, experience furnishes
the occasion, but is not the origin and source</i>. By a kind of lofty
inspiration, he caught sight of that most important doctrine of
modern philosophy, so clearly and logically presented by Kant,
<i>that the Reason is the source of a pure</i> à priori <i>knowledge</i>--a
knowledge native to, and potentially in the mind, antecedent
to all experience, and which is simply brought out into the field
of consciousness by experience conditions. Around this greatest
of all metaphysical truths Plato threw a gorgeous mythic
dress, and presented it under the most picturesque imagery.<a id="footnotetag560" name="footnotetag560"></a>
<a href="#footnote560"><sup class="sml">560</sup></a>
But, when divested of the rich coloring which the glowing imagination
of Plato threw over it, it is but a vivid presentation
of the cardinal truth that <i>there are ideas in the mind which have
not been derived from without</i>, and which, therefore, the mind
brought with it into the present sphere of being. The validity
and value of this fundamental doctrine, even as presented by
Plato, is unaffected by any speculations in which he may have
indulged, as to the pre-existence of the soul. He simply regarded
this doctrine of pre-existence as highly probable--a
plausible explanation of the facts. That there are ideas, innate
and connatural to the human mind, he clung to as the
most vital, most precious, most certain of all truths; and to
lead man to the recognitions of these ideas, to bring them within
the field of consciousness, was, in his judgment, the great
business of philosophy.</p>

<p>And this was the grand aim of his <i>Dialectic</i>--to elicit, to
bring to light the truths which are already in the mind--"a
µαίευσις" a kind of intellectual midwifery<a id="footnotetag561" name="footnotetag561"></a>

<p>It is thus, at first sight, obvious that it was a higher and
more comprehensive science than the art of deduction. For it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="356">356</a></span>
was directed to the discovery and establishment of First Principles.
Its sole object was the discovery of truth. His dialectic
was an <i>analytical</i> and <i>inductive method</i>. "In Dialectic Science,"
says <i>Alcinous</i>, "there is a dividing and a defining, and
an analyzing, and, moreover, that which is inductive and syllogistic."<a id="footnotetag562" name="footnotetag562"></a>
<a href="#footnote562"><sup class="sml">562</sup></a>
Even <i>Bacon</i>, who is usually styled "the Father of
the Inductive method," and who, too often, speaks disparagingly
of Plato, is constrained to admit that he followed the
inductive method. "An induction such as will be of advantage
for the invention and demonstration of Arts and Sciences
must distinguish the essential nature of things (naturam) by
proper rejections and exclusions, and then after as many of
these negatives as are sufficient, by comprising, above all (super),
the positives. Up to this time this had not been done,

<p>The process of investigation adopted by Plato thus corresponds
with the inductive method of modern times, with this
simple difference, that Bacon conducted science into the world
of <i>matter</i>, whilst Plato directed it to the world of <i>mind</i>. The
dialectic of Plato aimed at the discovery of the "laws of
thought;" the modern inductive philosophy aims at the discovery
of the "laws of nature." The latter concerns itself
chiefly with the inquiry after the "causes" of material phenomena;
the former concerned itself with the inquiry after the
"first principles" of all knowledge and of all existence. Both
processes are, therefore, carried on by <i>interrogation</i>. The analysis
which seeks for a law of nature proceeds by the interrogation
of nature. The analysis of Plato proceeds by the interrogation
of mind, in order to discover the fundamental <i>ideas</i>
which lie at the basis of all cognition, which determine all our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="357">357</a></span>
processes of thought, and which, in their final analysis, reveal
the REAL BEING, which is the ground and explanation of all
existence.</p>

<p>Now the fact that such an inquiry has originated in the
human mind, and that it can not rest satisfied without some
solution, is conclusive evidence that the mind has an instinctive
belief, a proleptic anticipation, that such knowledge can be
attained. There must unquestionably be some mental initiative
which is the <i>motive</i> and <i>guide</i> to all philosophical inquiry.
We must have some well-grounded conviction, some <i>à priori</i>
belief, some pre-cognition "ad intentionem ejus quod quæritur,"<a id="footnotetag564" name="footnotetag564"></a>
<a href="#footnote564"><sup class="sml">564</sup></a>
which determines the direction of our thinking. The
mind does not go to work aimlessly; it asks a specific question;
it demands the "<i>whence</i>" and the "<i>why</i>" of that which
is. Neither does it go to work unfurnished with any guiding
principles. That which impels the mind to a determinate act
of thinking is the possession of a <i>knowledge</i> which is different
from, and independent of, the process of thinking itself. "A
rational anticipation is, then, the ground of the <i>prudens quæstio</i>
--"the forethought query, which, in fact, is the prior half of the
knowledge sought."<a id="footnotetag565" name="footnotetag565"></a>
<a href="#footnote565"><sup class="sml">565</sup></a> If the mind inquire after "laws," and
"causes," and "reasons," and "grounds,"--the first principles
of all knowledge and of all existence,--"it must have the <i>à priori</i>
ideas of "law," and "cause," and "reason," and "being <i>in se"</i>
which, though dimly revealed to the mind previous to the discipline
of reflection, are yet unconsciously governing its spontaneous
modes of thought. The whole process of induction
has, then, some rational ground to proceed upon--some principles
deeper than science, and more certain than demonstration,
which reason contains within itself, and which induction
"draws out" into clearer light.</p>

<p>Now this mental initiative of every process of induction is

<p>The first business of Plato's dialectic is to demonstrate that
the ground and reason of all existence can not be found in the
mere objects of sense, nor in any opinions or judgments founded
upon sensation. Principles are only so far "first principles"
as they are permanent and unchangeable, depending on
neither time, nor place, nor circumstances. But the objects
of sense are in ceaseless flux and change; they are "<i>always
becoming</i>;" they can not be said to have any "<i>real being</i>."
They are not to-day what they were yesterday, and they will
never again be what they are now; consequently all opinions
founded on mere phenomena are equally fluctuating and uncertain.
Setting out, therefore, from the assumption of the fallaciousness
of "<i>opinion</i>" it examined the various hypotheses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="359">359</a></span>
which had been bequeathed by previous schools of philosophy,
or were now offered by contemporaneous speculators, and
showed they were utterly inadequate to the solution of the
problem. This scrutiny consisted in searching for the ground
of "contradiction"<a id="footnotetag571" name="footnotetag571"></a>
<a href="#footnote571"><sup class="sml">571</sup></a> with regard to each opinion founded on
sensation, and showing that opposite views were equally tenable.
It inquired on what ground these opinions were maintained,
and what consequences flowed therefrom, and it showed
that the grounds upon which "opinion" was founded, and the
conclusions which were drawn from it, were contradictory, and
consequently untrue.<a id="footnotetag572" name="footnotetag572"></a>
<a href="#footnote572"><sup class="sml">572</sup></a> "They," the Dialecticians, "examined
the opinions of men as if they were error; and bringing them
together by a reasoning process to the same point, they placed
them by the side of each other: and by so placing, they showed
that <i>the opinions are at one and the same time contrary to themselves,
about the same things, with reference to the same circumstances,
and according to the same premises</i>."<a id="footnotetag573" name="footnotetag573"></a>

<p>The dialectic process thus consisted almost entirely of <i>refutation</i>,<a id="footnotetag576" name="footnotetag576"></a>

or what both he and Aristotle denominated <i>elenchus</i>

<p>By the application of this method, Plato had not only exposed
the insufficiency and self-contradiction of all results obtained
by a mere <i>à posteriori</i> generalization of the simple facts
of experience, but he demonstrated, as a consequence, that we
are in possession of some elements of knowledge which have
not been derived from sensation; that there are, in all minds,
certain notions, principles, or ideas, which have been furnished
by a higher faculty than sense; and that these notions, principles,
or ideas, transcend the limits of experience, and reveal
the knowledge of <i>real being</i>--τὸ ὄντως ὄν--<i>Being in se</i>.</p>

<p>To determine what these principles or ideas are, Plato now
addresses himself to the <i>analysis of thought</i>. "It is the glory
of Plato to have borne the light of analysis into the most obscure
and inmost region; he searched out what, in this totality
which forms consciousness, is the province of reason; what
comes from it, and not from the imagination and the senses--from
within, and not from without."<a id="footnotetag578" name="footnotetag578"></a>
<a href="#footnote578"><sup class="sml">578</sup></a> Now to analyze is to decompose,
that is, to divide, and to define, in order to see better
that which really is. The chief logical instruments of the dialectic
method are, therefore, <i>Division</i> and <i>Definition</i>. "The
being able to <i>divide</i> according to genera, and not to consider
the same species as different, nor a different as the same,"<a id="footnotetag579" name="footnotetag579"></a>

<p>We have already seen that, in his first efforts at applying
reflection to the concrete phenomena of consciousness, Plato
had recognized two distinct classes of cognitions, marked by
characteristics essentially opposite;--one of "<i>sensible</i>" objects
having a definite outline, limit, and figure, and capable of being
imaged and represented to the mind in a determinate form--the
other of "<i>intelligible</i>" objects, which can not be outlined
or represented in the memory or the imagination by any figures
or images, and are, therefore, the objects of purely rational
conception. He found, also, that we arrive at one class of cognitions
"<i>mediately</i>" through images generated in the vital organism,
or by some testimony, definition, or explication of
others; whilst we arrive at the other class "<i>immediately</i>" by
simple intuition, or rational apperception. The mind stands
face to face with the object, and gazes directly upon it. The
reality of that object is revealed in its own light, and we find it
impossible to refuse our assent--that is, it is <i>self-evident</i>. One
class consisted of <i>contingent</i> ideas--that is, their objects are
conceived as existing, with the possibility, without any contradiction,
of conceiving of their non-existence; the other consisted
of <i>necessary</i> ideas--their objects are conceived as existing with
the absolute impossibility of conceiving of their non-existence.
Thus we can conceive of this book, this table, this earth, as not
existing, but we can not conceive the non-existence of space.
We can conceive of succession in time as not existing, but we
can not, in thought, annihilate duration. We can imagine this
or that particular thing not to have been, but we can not conceive
of the extinction of Being in itself. He further observed,
that one class of our cognitions are <i>conditional</i> ideas; the existence
of their objects is conceived only on the supposition of
some antecedent existence, as for example, the idea of qualities,
phenomena, events; whilst the other class of cognitions are
<i>unconditional</i> and <i>absolute</i>--we can conceive of their objects as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="362" >362</a></span>
existing independently and unconditionally--existing whether
any thing else does or does not exist, as space, duration, the
infinite, Being <i>in se</i>. And, finally, whilst some ideas appear in
us as <i>particular</i> and <i>individual</i>, determined and modified by
our own personality and liberty, there are others which are, in
the fullest sense, <i>universal</i>. They are not the creations of our
own minds, and they can not be changed by our own volitions.
They depend upon neither times, nor places, nor circumstances;
they are common to all minds, in all times, and in all places.
These ideas are the witnesses in our inmost being that there
is something beyond us, and above us; and beyond and above
all the contingent and fugitive phenomena around us. Beneath
all changes there is a <i>permanent</i> being. Beyond all finite and
conditional existance there is something <i>unconditional</i> and
<i>absolute</i>. Having determined that there are truths which are independent
of our own minds--truths which are not individual,
but universal--truths which would be truths even if our minds
did not perceive them, we are led onward to a <i>super-sensual</i>
and super-natural ground, on which they rest.</p>

<p>To reach this objective reality on which the ideas of reason
repose, is the grand effort of Plato's dialectic. He seeks, by a
rigid analysis, clearly to <i>separate</i>, and accurately to <i>define</i> the <i>à
priori</i> conceptions of reason. And it was only when he had
eliminated every element which is particular, contingent, and
relative, and had defined the results in precise and accurate
language, that he regarded the process as complete. The
ideas which are self-evident, universal, and necessary, were then
clearly disengaged, and raised to their pure and absolute form.
"You call the man dialectical who requires a reason of the
essence or being of each thing. As the dialectical man can
define the essence of every thing, so can he of the good. He
can <i>define</i> the idea of the good, <i>separating</i> it from all others--follow
it through all windings, as in a battle, resolved to mark
it, not according to opinion, but according to science."<a id="footnotetag581" name="footnotetag581"></a>

<p><i>Abstraction</i> is thus the process, the instrument of the Platonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="363" >363</a></span>
dialectic. It is important, however, that we should distinguish
between the method of <i>comparative</i> abstraction, as employed
in physical inquiry, and that <i>immediate</i> abstraction,
which is the special instrument of philosophy. The former
proceeds by comparison and generalization, the latter by simple
separation. The one yields a contingent general principle
as the result of the comparison of a number of individual cases,
the other gives an universal and necessary principle by the
analysis of a single concrete fact. As an illustration we may
instance "the principle of causality." To enable us to affirm
"that every event must have a cause," we do not need to compare
and generalize a great number of events. "The principle
which compels us to pronounce the judgment is already complete
in the first as in the last event; it can change in regard
to its object, it can not change in itself; it neither increases
nor decreases with the greater or less number of applications."<a id="footnotetag582" name="footnotetag582"></a>
<a href="#footnote582"><sup class="sml">582</sup></a>
In the presence of a single event, the universality and necessity
of this principle of causality is recognized with just as much
clearness and certainty as in the presence of a million events,
however carefully generalized.</p>

<p>Abstraction, then, it will be seen, creates nothing; neither
does it add any new element to the store of actual cognitions
already possessed by all human minds. It simply brings forward
into a clearer and more definite recognition, that which
necessarily belongs to the mind as part of its latent furniture,
and which, as a law of thought, has always unconsciously governed
all its spontaneous movements. As a process of rational
inquiry, it was needful to bring the mind into intelligible and
conscious communion with the world of <i>Ideas</i>. These ideas
are partially revealed in the sensible world, all things being
formed, as Plato believed, according to ideas as models and
exemplars, of which sensible objects are the copies. They are
more fully manifested in the constitution of the human mind
which, by virtue of its kindred nature with the original essence
or being, must know them intuitively and immediately. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="364">364</a></span>
they are brought out fully by the dialectic process, which disengages
them from all that is individual and phenomenal, and
sets them forth in their pure and absolute form.</p>

<p>But whilst Plato has certainly exhibited the true method of
investigation by which the ideas of reason are to be separated
from all concrete phenomena and set clearly before the mind,
he has not attempted a complete enumeration of the ideas of
reason; indeed, such an enumeration is still the grand desideratum
of philosophy. We can not fail, however, in the careful
study of his writings, to recognize the grand Triad of Absolute
Ideas--ideas which Cousin, after Plato, has so fully exhibited,
viz., the <i>True</i>, the <i>Beautiful</i>, and the <i>Good</i>.</p>

<h3>PLATONIC SCHEME OF IDEAS</h3>

<p>I. <i>The idea of</i> ABSOLUTE TRUTH or REALITY (τὸ ἀληθές--τὸ ὄν)--the
ground and efficient cause of all existence, and by participating
in which all phenomenal existence has only so far a
reality, sensible things being merely shadows and resemblances
of ideas. This idea is developed in the human intelligence in
its relation with the phenomenal world; as,</p>

<p>1. <i>The idea of</i> SUBSTANCE (οὐσία)--the ground of all phenomena,
"the being or essence of all things," the permanent
reality.--"Timæeus," ch. ix. and xii.; "Republic," bk. vii. ch.
xiv.; "Phædo,"§§ 63-67, 73.</p>

<p>2. <i>The idea of</i> CAUSE (αἰτία)--the power or efficiency by
which things that "become," or begin to be, are generated
or produced.--"Timæus," ch. ix.; "Sophist," § 109; "Philebus,"
§§ 45, 46.</p>

<p>3. <i>The idea of</i> IDENTITY (αὐτὸ τὸ ἴσον)--that which "does
not change," "is always the same, simple and uniform, incomposite
and indissoluble,"--that which constitutes personality
or self-hood.--"Phædo," §§ 61-75; "Timæus," ch.
ix.; "Republic," bk. ii. ch. xix. and xx.</p>

<p>4. <i>The idea of</i> UNITY (τὸ ἕν)--one <i>mind</i> or intelligence
pervading the universe, the comprehensive conscious <i>thought</i>
or <i>plan</i> which binds all parts of the universe in one great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="365" >365</a></span>
whole (τὸ πᾶν)--the principle of <i>order</i>.--"Timæus," ch. xi.
and xv.; "Republic," bk. vi. ch. xiii.; "Philebus," §§ 50-51.</p>

<p>5. <i>The idea of the</i> INFINITE (τὸ ἄπειρον)--that which is unlimited
and unconditioned, "has no parts, bounds, no beginning,
nor middle, nor end."--"Parmenides," §§ 22, 23.</p>

<p>II. <i>The idea of</i> ABSOLUTE BEAUTY (τὸ καλόν)--the formal
cause of the universe, and by participation in which all created
things have only so far a real beauty.--"Timæus," ch. xi,
"Greater Hippias," §§ 17, 18; "Republic," bk. v. ch. 22.</p>

<p>This idea is developed in the human intelligence in its relation
to the organic world; as,</p>

<p>
1. <i>The Idea of</i> PROPORTION or SYMMETRY (συµµετρἰα)--the
proper relation of parts to an organic whole resulting in a
harmony (κόσµος), and which relation admits of mathematical
expression.--"Timæus," ch. lxix.; "Philebus," § 155
("Timæus," ch. xi. and xii., where the relation of numerical
proportions to material elements is expounded).</p>

<p>2. <i>The idea of</i> DETERMINATE FORM (παράδειγµα ἀρχέτυπος)--the
eternal models or archetypes according to which all
things are framed, and which admit of geometrical representation.--"Timæus,"
ch. ix.; "Phædo," §112 ("Timæus," ch.
xxviii.-xxxi., where the relation of geometrical forms to material
elements is exhibited).</p>

<p>3. <i>The idea of</i> RHYTHM (ῥυθµός)--measured movement in
time and space, resulting in melody and grace.--"Republic,"
bk. iii. ch. xi. and xii.; "Philebus," § 21.</p>

<p>4. <i>The idea of</i> FITNESS or ADAPTATION (χρήσιον)--effectiveness
to some purpose or end.--"Greater Hippias," § 35.</p>

<p>5. <i>The idea of</i> PERFECTION (τελειότης)--that which is complete,
"a structure which is whole and finished--of whole

love of science is naturally carried in his aspirations to the

by the multitude of things whose reality is only apparent,
knows no repose until it have arrived at union with the

the permanent and essential; so that this divine conjunction

<p>To the mind of Plato, there was in every thing, even the
smallest and most insignificant of sensible objects, a <i>reality</i> just
in so far as it participates in some archetypal form or idea.
These archetypal forms or ideas are the "<i>thoughts of God</i>"<a id="footnotetag586" name="footnotetag586"></a>
<a href="#footnote586"><sup class="sml">586</sup></a>--they
are the plan according to which he framed the universe.
"The Creator and Father of the universe looked to an <i>eternal
model</i>.... Being thus generated, the universe is framed according
to principles that can be comprehended by reason and
reflection."<a id="footnotetag587" name="footnotetag587"></a>
<a href="#footnote587"><sup class="sml">587</sup></a> Plato, also, regarded all individual conceptions
of the mind as hypothetical notions which have in them an <i>à</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="368">368</a></span>
<i>priori</i> element--an idea which is unchangeable, universal, and
necessary. These unchangeable, universal, and necessary ideas
are copies of the Divine Ideas, which are, for man, the primordial
laws of all cognition, and all reasoning. They are possessed
by the soul "in virtue of its kindred nature to that
which is permanent, unchangeable, and eternal." He also believed
that every archetypal form, and every <i>à priori</i> idea, has
its ground and root in a higher idea, which is <i>unhypothetical</i>
and <i>absolute</i>--an idea which needs no other supposition for
its explanation, and which is, itself, needful to the explanation
of all existence--even the idea of an <i>absolute</i> and <i>perfect Being</i>,
in whose mind the ideas of absolute truth, and beauty, and
goodness inhere, and in whose eternity they can only be regarded
as eternal.<a id="footnotetag588" name="footnotetag588"></a>
<a href="#footnote588"><sup class="sml">588</sup></a> Thus do the "ideas of reason" not only
cast a bridge across the abyss that separates the sensible and
the ideal world, but they also carry us beyond the limits of our
personal consciousness, and discover to us a realm of real Being,
which is the foundation, and cause, and explanation of the
phenomenal world that appears around us and within us.</p>

<p>This, then, is the dialectic of Plato. Instead of losing himself
amid the endless variety of particular phenomena, he would
search for principles and laws, and from thence ascend to the
great Legislator, the <i>First Principle of all Principles</i>. Instead
of stopping at the relations of sensible objects to the general
ideas with which they are commingled, he will pass to their
<i>eternal Paradigms</i>--from the just thing to the idea of absolute
justice, from the particular good to the absolute good, from
beautiful things to the absolute beauty, and thence to the ultimate
reality--<i>the absolute Being</i>. By the realization of the
lower idea, embodied in the forms of the visible universe and
in the necessary laws of thought, he sought to rise to the higher
idea, in its pure and abstract form--the <i>Supreme Idea</i>, containing
in itself all other ideas--the <i>One Intelligence</i> which unites
the universe in a harmonious whole. "The Dialectic faculty
proceeds from hypothesis to an unhypothetical principle....
It uses hypotheses as steps, and starting-points, in order to
proceed from thence to the <i>absolute</i>. The Intuitive Reason
takes hold of the First Principle of the Universe, and avails itself
of all the connections and relations of that principle. It
ascends from idea to idea, until it has reached the Supreme
Idea"--the <i>Absolute Good</i>--that is, <i>God</i>.<a id="footnotetag590" name="footnotetag590"></a>

<p>We are thus brought, in the course of our examination of the
Platonic method, to the <i>results</i> obtained by this method--or, in
other words, to</p>

<h3>III. THE PLATONIC ONTOLOGY.</h3>

<p>The grand object of all philosophic inquiry in ancient
Greece was to attain to the knowledge of real Being--that Being
which is permanent, unchangeable, and eternal. It had
proceeded on the intuitive conviction, that beneath all the endless
diversity of the universe there must be a principle of <i>unity</i>--below
all fleeting appearances there must be a permanent
<i>substance</i>--beyond all this everlasting flow and change, this
beginning and end of finite existence, there must be an eternal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="370">370</a></span>
Being, which is the <i>cause</i>, and which contains, in itself, the
<i>reason</i> of the order, and harmony, and beauty, and excellency
which pervades the universe. And it had perpetually asked
what is this permanent, unchangeable, and eternal substance
or being?</p>

<p>Plato had assiduously labored at the solution of this problem.
The object of his dialectic was "to lead upward the
soul to the knowledge of real being,"<a id="footnotetag591" name="footnotetag591"></a>
<a href="#footnote591"><sup class="sml">591</sup></a> and the conclusions to
which he attained may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>1st. <i>Beneath all</i> SENSIBLE <i>phenomena there is an unchangeable
subject-matter, the mysterious substratum of the world of sense,
which he calls the receptacle (ἱποδοχή) the nurse (τιθήνη) of all that
is produced</i>.<a id="footnotetag592" name="footnotetag592"></a>
<a href="#footnote592"><sup class="sml">592</sup></a></p>

<p>It is this "substratum or physical groundwork" which gives
a reality and definiteness to the evanescent phantoms of sense,
for, in their ceaseless change, <i>they</i> can not justify any title whatever.
It alone can be styled "<i>this</i>" or "<i>that</i>" (τόδε or τοῦτο);
they rise no higher than "<i>of such kind</i>" or " of what kind or
quality" (τοιοῦτον or ὁποιονοῦν τι).<a id="footnotetag593" name="footnotetag593"></a>
<a href="#footnote593"><sup class="sml">593</sup></a> It is not earth, or air, or fire,
or water, but "an invisible <i>species</i> and formless universal receiver,
which, in the most obscure way, receives the immanence
of the intelligible."<a id="footnotetag594" name="footnotetag594"></a>
<a href="#footnote594"><sup class="sml">594</sup></a> And in relation to the other two principles
(<i>i.e.</i>, ideas and objects of sense), "it is <i>the mother</i>" to the father
and the offspring.<a id="footnotetag595" name="footnotetag595"></a>
<a href="#footnote595"><sup class="sml">595</sup></a> But perhaps the most remarkable passage
is that in which he seems to identify it with <i>pure space</i>,
which, "itself imperishable, furnishes a <i>seat</i> (ἕδραν) to all that is
produced, not apprehensible by direct perception, but caught
by a certain spurious reasoning, scarcely admissible, but which
we see as in a dream; gaining it by that judgment which pronounces
it necessary that all which is, be <i>somewhere</i>, and occupy
a <i>certain space</i>."<a id="footnotetag596" name="footnotetag596"></a>
<a href="#footnote596"><sup class="sml">596</sup></a> This, it will be seen, approaches the Cartesian
doctrine, which resolves matter into simple extension.<a id="footnotetag597" name="footnotetag597"></a>

<p>It should, however, be distinctly noted that Plato does not
use the word ὓλη--matter. This term is first employed by
Aristotle to express "the substance which is the subject of all
changes."<a id="footnotetag598" name="footnotetag598"></a>
<a href="#footnote598"><sup class="sml">598</sup></a> The subject or substratum of which Plato speaks,
would seem to be rather a logical than a material entity. It
is the <i>condition or supposition</i> necessary for the production of a
world of phenomena. It is thus the <i>transition-element</i> between
the real and the apparent, the eternal and the contingent; and,
lying thus on the border of both territories, we must not be surprised
that it can hardly be characterized by any definite attribute.<a id="footnotetag599" name="footnotetag599"></a>
<a href="#footnote599"><sup class="sml">599</sup></a>
Still, this unknown recipient of forms or ideas has
a <i>reality</i>; it has "an abiding nature," "a constancy of existence;"
and we are forbidden to call it by any name denoting
quality, but permitted to style it "<i>this</i>" and "<i>that</i>" (τόδε καὶ

<p>There has been much discussion as to whether Plato held
that this "<i>Receptacle</i>" and "<i>Nurse</i>" of forms and ideas was
eternal, or generated in time. Perhaps no one has more carefully
studied the writings of Plato than William Archer Butler,
and his conclusions in regard to this subject are presented in
the following words: "As, on the one hand, he maintained a
strict system of dualism, and avoided, without a single deviation,
that seduction of pantheism to which so many abstract
speculators of his own school have fallen victims; so, on the
other hand, it appears to me that he did not scruple to place
this principle, the opposite of the Divine intelligence, in a
sphere independent of temporal origination.... But we can
scarcely enter into his views, unless we ascertain his notions
of the nature of <i>Time</i> itself. This was considered to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="372" >372</a></span>
created with the rest of the sensible world, to finish with it, if
it ever finished--to be altogether related to this phenomenal
scene.<a id="footnotetag602" name="footnotetag602"></a>
<a href="#footnote602"><sup class="sml">602</sup></a> 'The generating Father determined to create a moving
image of eternity (αἰῶνος); and in disposing the heavens,
he framed of this eternity, reposing in its own unchangeable
unity, an eternal <i>image</i>, moving according to numerical succession,
which he called <i>Time</i>. With the world arose days, nights,
months, years, which all had no previous existence. The past
and future are but forms of time, which we most erroneously
transfer to the eternal substance (ἀίδιον οὐσίαν); we say it was,
and is, and will be, whereas we can only fitly say <i>it is</i>. Past
and future are appropriate to the successive nature of generated
beings, for they bespeak motion; but the Being eternally and
immovably the same is subject neither to youth nor age, nor
to any accident of time; it neither was, nor hath been, nor will
be, which are the attributes of fleeting sense--the circumstances
of time, imitating eternity in the shape of number and
motion. Nor can any thing be more inaccurate than to apply
the term <i>real being</i> to past, or present, or future, or even to
non-existence. Of this, however, we can not now speak fully.
<i>Time</i>, then, was formed with the heavens, that, together created,
they may together end, <i>if indeed an end be in the purpose of the
Creator</i>; and it is designed as closely as possible to resemble
the eternal nature, its exemplar. The model exists through all
eternity; the world has been, is, and will be through all <i>time</i>.'<a id="footnotetag603" name="footnotetag603"></a>
<a href="#footnote603"><sup class="sml">603</sup></a>
In this ineffable eternity Plato places the Supreme Being,
and the archetypal ideas of which the sensible world of time
partakes. Whether he also includes under the same mode of
existence the <i>subject-matter</i> of the sensible world, it is not easy
to pronounce; and it appears to me evident that he did not
himself undertake to speak with assurance on this obscure
problem."<a id="footnotetag604" name="footnotetag604"></a>
<a href="#footnote604"><sup class="sml">604</sup></a> The creation of matter "out of nothing" is an
idea which, in all probability, did not occur to the mind of
Plato. But that he regarded it as, in some sense, a <i>dependent</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="373" >373</a></span>
existence--as existing, like time, by "the purpose or will of the
Creator"--perhaps as an eternal "generation" from the "eternal
substance," is also highly probable; for in the last analysis
he evidently desires to embrace all things in some ultimate
<i>unity</i>--a tendency which it seems impossible for human reason
to avoid.</p>

<p>2d. <i>Beneath all mental phenomena there is a permanent subject
or substratum which he designates</i> THE IDENTICAL (τὸ αὐτό)--<i>the
rational element of the soul--"the principle of self-activity" or self-determination</i>.<a id="footnotetag605" name="footnotetag605"></a>
<a href="#footnote605"><sup class="sml">605</sup></a></p>

<p>There are three principles into which Plato analyzes the
soul--the principle of the <i>Identical</i>, the <i>Diverse</i>, and the <i>Intermediate
Essence</i>.<a id="footnotetag606" name="footnotetag606"></a>
<a href="#footnote606"><sup class="sml">606</sup></a> The first is indivisible and eternal, always
existing in <i>sameness</i>, the very substance of <i>Intelligence</i> itself, and
of the same nature with the Divine.<a id="footnotetag607" name="footnotetag607"></a>
<a href="#footnote607"><sup class="sml">607</sup></a> The second is divisible
and corporeal, answering to our notion of the passive <i>sensibilities</i>,
and placing the soul in relation with the visible world.
The third is an intermediate essence, partaking of the natures
of both, and constituting a medium between the eternal and
the mutable--the conscious <i>energy</i> of the soul developed in the
contingent world of time. Thus the soul is, on one side, linked
to the unchangeable and the eternal, being formed of that ineffable
element which constitutes the <i>real</i> or <i>immutable Being</i>,
and on the other side, linked to the sensible and the contingent,
being formed of that element which is purely <i>relative</i> and
<i>contingent</i>. This last element of the soul is regarded by Plato
as "mortal" and "corruptible," the former element as "immortal"
and "indestructible," having its foundations laid in
eternity.</p>

<p>This doctrine of the eternity of the free and rational element
of the soul must, of course, appear strange and even repulsive
to those who are unacquainted with the Platonic notion of
eternity as a fixed state out of time, which has no past, present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="374">374</a></span>
or future, and is simply that which "always <i>is</i>"--an everlasting
<i>now</i>. The soul, in its elements of rationality and freedom, has
existed anterior to time, because it now exists in eternity.<a id="footnotetag608" name="footnotetag608"></a>
<a href="#footnote608"><sup class="sml">608</sup></a> In
its actual manifestations and personal history it is to be contemplated
as a "generated being," having a commencement in
time.</p>

<p>Now, that the human soul, like the uncreated Deity, has always
had a distinct, conscious, personal, independent being,
does not appear to be the doctrine of Plato. He teaches, most
distinctly, that the "divine," the immortal part, was created, or
rather "generated," in eternity. "The Deity himself <i>formed
the divine</i>, and he delivered over to his celestial offspring [the
subordinate and generated gods] the task of <i>forming the mortal</i>.

<p>That portion of the soul which Plato regarded as "immortal"
and "to be entitled divine," is thus the "<i>offspring of God</i>"--a
ray of the Divinity "generated" by, or emanating from, the
Deity. He seems to have conceived it as co-eternal with its
ideal objects, in some mysterious ultimate <i>unity</i>. "The true
foundation of the Platonic theory of the constitution of the soul
is this fundamental principle of his philosophy--the <i>oneness of
truth and knowledge</i>.<a id="footnotetag611" name="footnotetag611"></a>
<a href="#footnote611"><sup class="sml">611</sup></a> This led him naturally to derive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="375" >375</a></span>
<i>rational</i> element of the soul (that element that <i>knows</i>), that possesses
the power of νόησις from the <i>real</i> element in things (the
element that <i>is</i>)--the νοούµενον; and in the original, the final,
and, though imperfectly, the present state of that rational element,
he, doubtless, conceived it united with its object in an
eternal conjunction, or even identity. But though intelligence
and its correlative intelligibles were and are thus combined,
the soul is <i>more</i> than pure intelligence; it possesses an element
of personality and consciousness distinct to each individual, of
which we have no reason to suppose, from any thing his writings
contain, Plato ever meant to deprive it."<a id="footnotetag612" name="footnotetag612"></a>
<a href="#footnote612"><sup class="sml">612</sup></a> On the contrary,
he not only regarded it as having now, under temporal conditions,
a distinct personal existence, but he also claimed for it a
conscious, personal existence after death. He is most earnest,
and unequivocal, and consistent in his assertion of the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul. The arguments which human
reason can supply are exhibited with peculiar force and beauty
in the "Phædo," the "Phædrus," and the tenth book of the
"Republic." The most important of these arguments may be
presented in a few words.</p>

<p>1. <i>The soul is immortal, because it is incorporeal</i>. There are
two kinds of existences, one compounded, the other simple;
the former subject to change, the latter unchangeable; one
perceptible to sense, the other comprehended by mind alone.
The one is visible, the other is invisible. When the soul employs
the bodily senses, it wanders and is confused; but when
it abstracts itself from the body, it attains to knowledge which
is stable, unchangeable, and immortal. The soul, therefore,
being uncompounded, incorporeal, invisible, must be indissoluble--that
is to say, immortal.<a id="footnotetag613" name="footnotetag613"></a>

<p>2. <i>The soul is immortal, because it has an independent power
of self-motion</i>--that is, it has self-activity and self-determination.
No arrangement of matter, no configuration of body, can be
conceived as the originator of free and voluntary movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="376">376</a></span></p>

<p>Now that which can not move itself, but derives its motion
from something else, may cease to move, and perish. "But
that which is self-moved, never ceases to be active, and is also
the cause of motion to all other things that are moved." And
"whatever is continually active is immortal." This "self-activity
is," says Plato, "the very essence and true notion of the
soul."<a id="footnotetag614" name="footnotetag614"></a>
<a href="#footnote614"><sup class="sml">614</sup></a> Being thus essentially <i>causative</i>, it therefore partakes
of the nature of a "principle," and it is the nature of a principle
to exclude its <i>contrary</i>. That which is essentially self-active
can never cease to be active; that which is the cause of motion
and of change, can not be extinguished by the change called
death.<a id="footnotetag615" name="footnotetag615"></a>
<a href="#footnote615"><sup class="sml">615</sup></a></p>

<p>3. <i>The soul is immortal, because it possesses universal, necessary,
and absolute ideas</i>, which transcend all material conditions,
and bespeak an origin immeasurably above the body. No modifications
of matter, however refined, however elaborated, can
give the Absolute, the Necessary, the Eternal. But the soul has
the ideas of absolute beauty, goodness, perfection, identity, and
duration, and it possesses these ideas in virtue of its having a
nature which is one, simple, identical, and in some sense, eternal.<a id="footnotetag616" name="footnotetag616"></a>
<a href="#footnote616"><sup class="sml">616</sup></a>
If the soul can conceive an immortality, it can not be
less than immortal. If, by its very nature, "it has hopes that
will not be bounded by the grave, and desires and longings
that grasp eternity," its nature and its destiny must correspond.</p>

<p>In the concluding sections of the "Phædo" he urges the

virtuous life, for "the reward is noble and the hope is great."<a id="footnotetag617" name="footnotetag617"></a>

of God.<a id="footnotetag618" name="footnotetag618"></a>

(return) </a> The doctrine of Metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, can scarcely
be regarded as part of the philosophic system of Plato. He seems to
have accepted it as a venerable tradition, coming within the range of probability,
rather than as a philosophic truth, and it is always presented by him
in a highly mythical dress. Now of these mythical representations he remarks
in the "Phædo" (§ 145) that "no man in his senses would dream of
insisting <i>that they correspond to the reality</i>, but that, the soul having been
shown to be immortal, this, or something like this, is true of individual souls
or their habitations." If, as in the opinions of the ablest critics, "the Laws"
is to be placed amongst the last and maturest of Plato's writings, the evidence
is conclusive that whatever may have been his earlier opinions, he did
not entertain the doctrine of "Metempsychosis" in his riper years. But
when, on the one hand, the soul shall remain having an intercourse with divine
virtue, it becomes divine pre-eminently; and pre-eminently, after having
been conveyed to a <i>place</i> entirely holy, it is changed for the better; but
when it acts in a contrary manner, it has, under contrary circumstances,
placed its existence in some <i>unholy spot</i>.

beauty the <i>formal cause</i>, and the Divine goodness the

<p><i>The eternal unity of the principles of Order, Goodness, and
Truth, in an ultimate reality--the</i> ETERNAL MIND, is thus the
fundamental principle which pervades the whole of the Platonic
philosophy. And now, having attained this sublime elevation,
he looks down from thence upon the <i>sensible, the phenomenal
world</i>, and upon <i>the temporal life of man;</i> and in the light
of this great principle he attempts to explain their meaning

<h3>I. PLATONIC PHYSICS.</h3>

<p>Firmly believing in the absolute excellence of the Deity,
and regarding the Divine Goodness as the Final Cause of the
universe, he pronounces the physical world to be an <i>image</i> of
the perfection of God. Anaxagoras, no doubt, prepared the
way for this theory. Every one who has read the "Phædo,"
will remember the remarkable passage in which Socrates gives
utterance to the disappointment which he had experienced
when expecting from physical science an explanation of the
universe. "When I was young," he said--"it is not to be told
how eager I was about physical inquiries, and curious to know
<i>how the universe came to be as it is</i>; and when I heard that
Anaxagoras was teaching that all was arranged by <i>mind</i>, I was
delighted with the prospect of hearing such a doctrine unfolded;
I thought to myself, if he teaches that mind made every
thing to be as it is, he will explain <i>how it is</i> BEST <i>for it to be</i>,
and show that so it is." But Anaxagoras, it appears, lost sight
of this principle, and descended to the explanation of the universe
by material causes. "Great was my hope," says Socrates,
"and equally great my disappointment."<a id="footnotetag645" name="footnotetag645"></a>

<p>Plato accepted this suggestion of Anaxagoras with all his
peculiar earnestness, and devoted himself to its fuller development.
It were a vain and profitless theory, which, whilst it
assumed the existence of a Supreme Mind, did not represent
that mind as operating in the universe by <i>design</i>, and as exhibiting
his intelligence, and justice, and goodness, as well as his
power, in every thing. If it be granted that there is a Supreme
Mind, then, argued Plato, he must be regarded as "the measure
of all things," and all things must have been framed according
to a plan or "model" which that mind supplied. Intelligence
must be regarded as having a <i>purpose</i>, and as working
towards an <i>end</i>, for it is this alone which distinguishes reason
from unreason, and mind from mere unintelligent force. The
only proper model which could be presented to the Supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="381" >381</a></span>
Intelligence is "the eternal and unchangeable model"<a id="footnotetag646" name="footnotetag646"></a>
<a href="#footnote646"><sup class="sml">646</sup></a> which
his own perfection supplies, "for he is the most excellent of
causes."<a id="footnotetag647" name="footnotetag647"></a>
<a href="#footnote647"><sup class="sml">647</sup></a> Thus God is not simply the maker of the universe,
but the model of the universe, because he designed that it
should be an IMAGE, in the sphere of sense, of his own perfections--a
revelation of his eternal beauty, and wisdom, and
goodness, and truth. "God was <i>good</i>, and being good, he desired
that the universe should, as far as possible, <i>resemble</i> himself....
Desiring that all things should be <i>good</i>, and, as far
as might be, nothing evil, he took the fluctuating mass of
things visible, which had been in orderless confusion, and reduced
it to <i>order</i>, considering this to be the <i>better</i> state. Now
it was and is utterly impossible for the supremely good to form
any thing except that which is <i>most excellent</i> (κάλλιστον--most
fair, most beautiful").<a id="footnotetag648" name="footnotetag648"></a>
<a href="#footnote648"><sup class="sml">648</sup></a> The object at which the supreme mind
aimed being that which is "<i>best</i>," we must, in tracing his operations
in the universe, always look for "<i>the best</i>" in every
thing.<a id="footnotetag649" name="footnotetag649"></a>
<a href="#footnote649"><sup class="sml">649</sup></a> Starting out thus, upon the assumption that the goodness
of God is the final cause of the universe, Plato evolved a
system of <i>optimism</i>.</p>

<p>The physical system of Plato being thus intended to illustrate
a principle of optimism, the following results may be expected:</p>

<p>1. That it will mainly concern itself with <i>final causes</i>. The
universe being regarded chiefly, as indeed it is, an indication
of the Divine Intelligence--every phenomenon will be contemplated
in that light. Nature is the volume in which the Deity
reveals his own perfections; it is therefore to be studied solely
with this motive, that we may learn from thence the perfection
of God. The <i>Timæus</i> is a series of ingenious hypotheses
designed to deepen and vivify our sense of the harmony, and
symmetry, and beauty of the universe, and, as a consequence,
of the wisdom, and excellence, and goodness, of its Author.<a id="footnotetag650" name="footnotetag650"></a>

<p>The application of this fundamental conception of the Platonic
system--<i>the eternal unity of the principles of Order, Goodness,
and Truth in an ultimate reality, the Eternal Mind</i>--to the
elucidation of the <i>temporal life</i> of man, yields, as a result--</p>

<h3>II. THE PLATONIC ETHICS.</h3>

<p>Believing firmly that there are unchangeable, necessary, and
absolute principles, which are the perfections of the Eternal
Mind, Plato must, of course, have been a believer in an <i>immutable
morality</i>. He held that there is a rightness, a justice, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="384">384</a></span>
equity, not arbitrarily constituted by the Divine will or legislation,
but founded in the nature of God, and therefore eternal.
The independence of the principles of morality upon the mere
will of the Supreme Governor is proclaimed in all his writings.<a id="footnotetag662" name="footnotetag662"></a>
<a href="#footnote662"><sup class="sml">662</sup></a>
The Divine will is the fountain of efficiency, the Divine reason,
the fountain of law. God is no more the creator of <i>virtue</i> than
he is the creator of <i>truth</i>.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as man is a partaker of the Divine essence,
and as the ideas which dwell in the human reason are "copies"
of those which dwell in the Divine reason, man may rise to the
apprehension and recognition of the immutable and eternal
principles of righteousness, and "by communion with that
which is Divine, and subject to the law of order, may become
himself a subject of order, and divine, so far as it is possible for
man."<a id="footnotetag663" name="footnotetag663"></a>

<p>The attainment of this consummation is the grand purpose
of the Platonic philosophy. Its ultimate object is "<i>the purification
of the soul</i>," and its pervading spirit is the aspiration after
perfection. The whole system of Plato has therefore an eminently
<i>ethical</i> character. It is a speculative philosophy directed
to a practical purpose.</p>

<p>Philosophy is the <i>love of wisdom</i>. Now wisdom (σοφία) is
expressly declared by Plato to belong alone to the Supreme
Divinity,<a id="footnotetag664" name="footnotetag664"></a>
<a href="#footnote664"><sup class="sml">664</sup></a> who alone can contemplate reality in a direct and
immediate manner, and in whom, as Plato seems often to intimate,
knowledge and being coincide. Philosophy is the aspiration
of the soul after this wisdom, this perfect and immutable
truth, and in its realization it is a union with the Perfect Wisdom
through the medium of a divine affection, the <i>love</i> of which
Plato so often speaks. The eternal and unchangeable Essence
which is the proper object of philosophy is also endowed with
<i>moral</i> attributes. He is not only "the Being," but "the Good"
(τὸ ἀγαθόν), and all in the system of the universe which can be
the object of rational contemplation, is an emanation from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="385">385</a></span>
goodness. The love of truth is therefore the love of God, and
the love of Good is the love of truth. Philosophy and morality
are thus coincident. Philosophy is the love of Perfect Wisdom;
Perfect Wisdom and Perfect Goodness are identical; the
Perfect Good is God; philosophy is the "<i>Love of God</i>."<a id="footnotetag665" name="footnotetag665"></a>
<a href="#footnote665"><sup class="sml">665</sup></a> Ethically
viewed, it is this one motive of <i>love</i> for the Supreme Wisdom
and Goodness, predominating over and purifying and assimilating
every desire of the soul, and governing every movement
of the man, raising man to a participation of and communion
with Divinity, and restoring him to "the <i>likeness</i> of
God." "This flight," says Plato, "consists in resembling God
(όµοίωσιϛ Θεῷ), and this resemblance is the becoming just and
holy with wisdom."<a id="footnotetag666" name="footnotetag666"></a>
<a href="#footnote666"><sup class="sml">666</sup></a> "This assimilation to God is the enfranchisement
of the divine element of the soul. To approach to
God as the substance of truth is <i>Science</i>; as the substance of
goodness in truth is <i>Wisdom</i>, and as the substance of Beauty
in goodness and truth is <i>Love</i>."<a id="footnotetag667" name="footnotetag667"></a>
<a href="#footnote667"><sup class="sml">667</sup></a></p>

<p>The two great principles which can be clearly traced as pervading
the ethical system of Plato are--</p>

<p>1. <i>That no man is willingly evil</i>.<a id="footnotetag668" name="footnotetag668"></a>
<a href="#footnote668"><sup class="sml">668</sup></a></p>

<p>The first of these principles is the counterpart ethical expression
of his theory of <i>immutable Being</i>. The second is the
counterpart of his theory of phenomenal change, or <i>mere Becoming</i>.</p>

<p>The soul of man is framed after the pattern of the immutable
ideas of the <i>just</i>, and the <i>true</i>, and the <i>good</i>, which dwell in the
Eternal Mind--that is, it is made in the image of God. The
soul in its ultimate essence is formed of "the immutable" and
"the permanent." The presence of the ideas of the just, and
the true, and the good in the reason of man, constitute him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="386" >386</a></span>
moral nature; and it is impossible that he can cease to be a
moral being, for these ideas, having a permanent and immutable
being, can not be changed. All the passions and affections
of the soul are merely phenomenal. They belong to the mortal,
the transitory life of man; they are in endless flow and
change, and they have no permanent reality. As phenomena,
they must, however, have some ground; and Plato found that
ground in the mysterious, instinctive longing for the <i>good</i> and
the <i>true</i> which dwells in the very essence of the soul. These
are the realities after which it strives, even when pursuing
pleasure, and honor, and wealth, and fame. All the restlessness
of human life is prompted by a longing for the <i>good</i>. But
man does not clearly perceive what the <i>good</i> really is. The rational
element of the soul has become clouded by passion and
ignorance, and suffered an eclipse of its powers. Still, man
longs for the good, and bears witness, by his restlessness and
disquietude, that he instinctively desires it, and that he can find
no rest and no satisfaction in any thing apart from the knowledge
and the participation of the Supreme, the Absolute Good.</p>

<p>This, then, is the meaning of the oft-repeated assertion of
Plato "<i>that no man is willingly evil</i>;" viz., that no man deliberately
chooses evil as evil. And Plato is, at the same time, careful
to guard the doctrine from misconception. He readily
grants that acts of wrong are distinguished as voluntary and
involuntary, without which there could be neither merit nor demerit,
reward nor punishment.<a id="footnotetag670" name="footnotetag670"></a>
<a href="#footnote670"><sup class="sml">670</sup></a> But still he insists that no
man chooses evil in and by itself. He may choose it voluntarily
as a means, but he does not choose it as an end. Every
volition, by its essential nature, pursues, at least, an <i>apparent</i>
good; because the end of volition is not the immediate act,
but the object for the sake of which the act is undertaken.<a id="footnotetag671" name="footnotetag671"></a>

<p>How is it, then, it may be asked, that men become evil?
The answer of Plato is, that the soul has in it a principle of
change, in the power of regulating the desires--in indulging
them to excess, or moderating them according to the demands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="387">387</a></span>
of reason. The circumstances in which the soul is placed, as
connected with the sensible world by means of the body, present
an occasion for the exercise of that power, the end of this
temporal connection being to establish a state of moral discipline
and probation. The humors and distempers of the body
likewise deprave, disorder, and discompose the soul.<a id="footnotetag672" name="footnotetag675"></a>
<a href="#footnote672"><sup class="sml">672</sup></a> "Pleasures
and pains are unduly magnified; the democracy of the
passions prevails; and the ascendency of reason is cast down."
Bad forms of civil government corrupt social manners, evil
education effects the ruin of the soul. Thus the soul is
changed--is fallen from what it was when first it came from
the Creator's hand. But the eternal Ideas are not utterly
effaced, the image of God is not entirely lost. The soul may
yet be restored by remedial measures. It may be purified
by knowledge, by truth, by expiations, by sufferings, and by
prayers. The utmost, however, that man can hope to do in
this life is insufficient to fully restore the image of God, and
death must complete the final emancipation of the rational element
from the bondage of the flesh. Life is thus a discipline
and a preparation for another state of being, and death the
final entrance there.<a id="footnotetag673" name="footnotetag673"></a>

<p>Independent of all other considerations, virtue is, therefore,
to be pursued as the true good of the soul. Wisdom, Fortitude,
Temperance, Justice, the four cardinal virtues of the Platonic
system, are to be cultivated as the means of securing the
purification and perfection of the inner man. And the ordinary
pleasures, "the lesser goods" of life, are only to be so far
pursued as they are subservient to, and compatible with, the
higher and holier duty of striving after "the resemblance to
God."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ATHENS (<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<h3>THE SOCRATIC SCHOOL (<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<h3>ARISTOTLE.</h3>

<p>Aristotle was born at Stagira, a Greek colony of
Thrace, B.C. 384. His father, Nicomachus, was a physician
in the Court of Amyntas II., King of Macedonia, and is
reported to have written several works on Medicine and Natural
History. From his father, Aristotle seems to have inherited
a love for the natural sciences, which was fostered by the circumstances
which surrounded him in early life, and which exerted
a determining influence upon the studies of his riper years.</p>

<p>Impelled by an insatiate desire for knowledge, he, at seventeen
years of age, repaired to Athens, the city of Plato and
the university of the world. Plato was then absent in Sicily;
on his return Aristotle entered his school, became an ardent
student of philosophy, and remained until the death of Plato,
B.C. 348. He therefore listened to the instructions of Plato
for twenty years.</p>

<p>The mental characteristics of the pupil and the teacher were
strikingly dissimilar. Plato was poetic, ideal, and in some degree
mystical. Aristotle was prosaic, systematic, and practical.
Plato was intuitive and synthetical. Aristotle was logical
and analytical. It was therefore but natural that, to the mind
of Aristotle, there should appear something confused, irregular,
and incomplete in the discourses of his master. There was a
strange commingling of questions concerning the grounds of
morality, and statements concerning the nature of science; of
inquiries concerning "real being," and speculations on the ordering
of a model Republic, in the same discourse. Ethics,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="389" >389</a></span>
politics, ontology, and theology, are all comprised in his Dialectic,
which is, in fact, the one grand "science of the idea of the
good." Now to the mind of Aristotle it seemed better, and
much more systematic, that these questions should be separated,
and referred to particular heads; and, above all, that they
should be thoroughly discussed in an exact and settled terminology.
To arrange and classify all the objects of knowledge,
to discuss them systematically and, as far as possible, exhaustively,
was evidently the ambition, perhaps also the special
function, of Aristotle. He would survey the entire field of human
knowledge; he would study nature as well as humanity,
matter as well as mind, language as well as thought; he would
define the proper limits of each department of study, and present
a regular statement of the facts and principles of each
science. And, in fact, he was the first who really separated
the different sciences and erected them into distinct systems,
each resting upon its own proper principles. He distributed
philosophy into three branches:--(i.) <i>Theoretic</i>; (ii.) <i>Efficient</i>;
(iii.) <i>Practical</i>. The Theoretic he divided into--1. <i>Physics</i>;
<i>2. Mathematics</i>; 3. <i>Theology</i>, or the Prime Philosophy--the
science known in modern times as Metaphysics. The Efficient
embraces what we now term the arts,--1. <i>Logic; 2. Rhetoric</i>;
3. <i>Poetics</i>. The Practical comprises--<i>1. Ethics</i>; 2. <i>Politics</i>. On
all these subjects he wrote separate treatises. Thus, whilst
Plato is the genius of abstraction, Aristotle is eminently the
genius of classification.</p>

<p>Such being the mental characteristics of the two men--their
type of mind so opposite--we are prepared to expect that, in

from that of Plato, and that the teachings of Aristotle
will give a new direction to philosophic thought.</p>

<p class="mid"><b>ARISTOTELIAN ORGANON.</b></p>

<p>Plato made use of psychological and logical analysis in order
to draw from the depth of consciousness certain fundamental
ideas which are inherent in the mind--born with it, and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="390" >390</a></span>
derived from sense or experience. These ideas he designates
"the intelligible species" (τὰ νοουµενα γένη) as opposed to "the
visible species"--the objects of sense. Such ideas or principles
being found, he uses them as "starting-points" from
which he may pass beyond the sensible world and ascend to
"the absolute," that is, to God.<a id="footnotetag674" name="footnotetag674"></a>
<a href="#footnote674"><sup class="sml">674</sup></a> Having thus, by immediate
abstraction, attained to universal and necessary ideas, he descends
to the outer world, and attempts by these ideas to construct
an intellectual theory of the universe.<a id="footnotetag675" name="footnotetag675"></a>
<a href="#footnote675"><sup class="sml">675</sup></a></p>

<p>Aristotle will reverse this process. He will commence with
<i>sensation</i>, and proceed, by induction, from the known to the unknown.</p>

<p>The repetition of sensations produces <i>recollection</i>, recollection
<i>experience</i>, and experience produces <i>science</i>.<a id="footnotetag676" name="footnotetag676"></a>

of a certain disease, and that the same remedy has produced
the same effect on Socrates and on several other persons, that
is <i>Experience</i>; but to know that a certain remedy will cure all

<p>Disregarding the Platonic notion of the unity of all Being
in the absolute idea, he fixed his immediate attention on the
manifoldness of the phenomenal, and by a classification of
all the objects of experience he sought to attain to "general
notions." Concentrating all his attention on the individual,
the contingent, the particular, he ascends, by induction, from
the particular to the <i>general</i>; and then, by a strange paralogism,
"the <i>universal</i>" is confounded with "the <i>general</i>" or, by
a species of logical sleight-of-hand, the general is transmuted
into the universal. Thus "induction is the pathway from

<p>Aristotle admits, however, that there are ideas or principles
in the mind which can not be explained by experience, and we
are therefore entitled to an answer to the question--how are
these obtained? "Sensible experience gives us what is <i>here</i>,

it to give what is <i>everywhere</i> and <i>at all times</i>."<a id="footnotetag680" name="footnotetag680"></a>

further, that "science is a conception of the mind engaged in

positions of Aristotle:

<p>"On the supposition of the mind virtually containing, antecedent to all
experience, certain universal principles of knowledge, in the form of certain
necessities of thinking; still it is only by repeated and comparative experiments
that we compass the certainty; on the one hand, that such and such
cognitions can not but be thought as necessary, native generalities; and, on
the other, that such and such cognitions may or may not be thought, and
are, therefore, as contingent, factitious generalizations. To this process of
experiment, analysis, and classification, through which we attain to a scientific
knowledge of principles, it might be shown that Aristotle, not improperly,
applies the term <i>Induction</i>."--"Philosophy," p. 88.</p></blockquote>

<p>The human mind, he tells us, has two kinds of intelligence--the
<i>passive</i> intelligence (νοῦς παθητικός), which is the receptacle
of forms (δεκτικὸν τοῦ εὶδους); and the <i>active</i> intelligence (νοῦς
ποιητικός), which impresses the seal of thought upon the data
furnished by experience, and combines them into the unity of a
single judgment, thus attaining "general notions."<a id="footnotetag688" name="footnotetag688"></a>
<a href="#footnote688"><sup class="sml">688</sup></a> The passive
intelligence (the "external perception" of modern psychology)
perceives the individual forms which appear in the
external world, and the active intelligence (the intellect proper)
classifies and generalizes according to fixed laws or principles
inherent in itself; but of these fixed laws--πρῶτα νοήµατα--first
thoughts, or <i>à priori</i> ideas, he offers no proper account; they
are, at most, purely subjective. This, it would seem, was, in
effect, a return to the doctrine of Protagoras and his school,
"that man--the individual--is the measure of all things." The
aspects under which objects present themselves in consciousness,
constitute our only ground of knowledge; we have no
direct, intuitive knowledge of Being <i>in se</i>. The noetic faculty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="393">393</a></span>
is simply a <i>regulative</i> faculty; it furnishes the laws under which
we compare and judge, but it does not supply any original elements
of knowledge. Individual things are the only real entities,<a id="footnotetag689" name="footnotetag689"></a>
<a href="#footnote689"><sup class="sml">689</sup></a>
and "universals" have no separate existence apart from
individuals in which they inhere as attributes or properties.
They are consequently pure mental conceptions, which are fixed
and recalled by general names. He thus substitutes a species
of conceptual-nominalism in place of the realism of Plato. It is
true that "real being" (τὸ ὄν) is with Aristotle a subject of metaphysical
inquiry, but the proper, if not the only subsistence, or
οὐαία, is the form or abstract nature of things. "The essence
or very nature of a thing is inherent in the <i>form</i> and <i>energy</i>"<a id="footnotetag690" name="footnotetag690"></a>
<a href="#footnote690"><sup class="sml">690</sup></a>
The science of Metaphysics is strictly conversant about these
abstract intellectual forms just as Natural Philosophy is conversant
about external objects, of which the senses give us information.
Our knowledge of these intellectual forms is, however,
founded upon "beliefs" rather than upon immediate intuition,
and the objective certainty of science, upon the subjective
necessity of believing, and not upon direct apperception.</p>

<p>The points of contrast between the two methods may now
be presented in a few sentences. Plato held that all our cognitions
are reducible to two elements--one derived from <i>sense</i>,
the other from <i>pure reason</i>; one element particular, contingent,
and relative, the other universal, necessary, and absolute. By
an act of <i>immediate abstraction</i> Plato will eliminate the particular,
contingent, and relative phenomena, and disengage the
universal, necessary, and absolute <i>ideas</i> which underlie and
determine all phenomena. These ideas are the thoughts of
the Divine Mind, according to which all particular and individual
existences are generated, and, as divine thoughts, they
are real and permanent existences. Thus by a process of immediate
abstraction, he will rise from particular and contingent
phenomena to universal and necessary principles, and from
these to the First Principle of all principles, the First Cause
of all causes--that is, to <i>God</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="394" >394</a></span>

<p>Aristotle, on the contrary, held that all of our knowledge begins
with "the singular," that is, with the particular and the
relative, and is derived from sensation and experience. The
"sensible object," taken as it is without any sifting and probing,
is the basis of science, and reason is simply the architect
constructing science according to certain "forms" or laws inherent
in mind. The object, then, of metaphysical science is
to investigate those "universal notions" under which the mind
conceives of and represents to itself external objects, and
speculates concerning them. Aristotle, therefore, agrees with
Plato in teaching "that science can only be a science of universals,"<a id="footnotetag691" name="footnotetag691"></a>
<a href="#footnote691"><sup class="sml">691</sup></a>
and "that sensation alone can not furnish us with
scientific knowledge."<a id="footnotetag692" name="footnotetag692"></a>
<a href="#footnote692"><sup class="sml">692</sup></a> How, then, does he propose to attain
the knowledge of universal principles? How will he perform
that feat which he calls "passing from the known to the unknown?"
The answer is, by <i>comparative abstraction</i>. The universal
being constituted by a relation of the object to the thinking
subject, that is, by a property recognized by the intelligence
alone, in virtue of which it can be retained as an object
of thought, and compared with other objects, he proposes to
<i>compare, analyze, define,</i> and <i>classify</i> the primary cognitions, and
thus evoke into energy, and clearly present those principles or
forms of the intelligence which he denominate "universals."
As yet, however, he has only attained to "general notions,"
which are purely subjective, that is, to logical definitions, and
these logical definitions are subsequently elevated to the dignity
of "universal principles and causes" by a species of philosophic
legerdemain. Philosophy is thus stripped of its metaphysical
character, and assumes a strictly <i>logical</i> aspect. The
key of the Aristotelian method is therefore the</p>

<p class="mid"><b>ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC.</b></p>

<p>Pure Logic is the science of the formal laws of thought. Its
office is to ascertain the rules or conditions under which the
mind, by its own constitution, reasons and discourses. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="395">395</a></span>
office of Applied Logic--of logic as an art--is "to form and
judge of conclusions, and, through conclusions, to establish
proof. The conclusions, however, arise from propositions, and
the propositions from conceptions." It is chiefly under the
latter aspect that logic is treated by Aristotle. According to
this natural point of view he has divided the contents of the
logical and dialectic teaching in the different treatises of the
<i>Organon</i>.</p>

<p>The first treatise is the "<i>Categories</i>" or "Predicaments"--a
work which treats of the universal determinations of Being. It
is a classification of all our mental conceptions. As a matter
of fact, the mind forms notions or conceptions about those
natures and essences of things which present an outward image
to the senses, or those, equally real, which utter themselves to
the mind. These may be defined and classified; there may
be general conceptions to which all particular conceptions are
referable. This classification has been attempted by Aristotle,
and as the result we have the ten "Categories" of <i>Substance,
Quantity, Quality, Relation, Time, Place, Position, Possession,
Action, Passion</i>. He does not pretend that this classification
is complete, but he held these "Predicaments" to be the most
universal expressions for the various relations of things, under
some one of which every thing might be reduced.</p>

<p>The second treatise, "<i>On Interpretation</i>," investigates language
as the expression of thought; and inasmuch as a true
or false thought must be expressed by the union or separation
of a subject and a predicate, he deems it necessary to discuss
the parts of speech--the general term and the verb--and
the modes of affirmation and denial. In this treatise he develops
the nature and limitations of propositions, the meaning
of contraries and contradictions, and the force of affirmations
and denials in <i>possible, contingent</i>, and <i>necessary</i> matter.</p>

<p>The third are the "<i>Analytics</i>," which show how conclusions
are to be referred back to their principles, and arranged in the
order of their precedence.</p>

<p>The First or Prior Analytic presents the universal doctrine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="396" >396</a></span>
of the Syllogism, its principles and forms, and teaches how
must reason, if we would not violate the laws of our own mind.
The theory of reasoning, generally, with a view to accurate
demonstration, depends upon the construction of a perfect
syllogism, which is defined as "a discourse in which, certain
things being laid down, something else different from the
premises necessarily results, in consequence of their
existence."<a id="footnotetag693" name="footnotetag693"></a>
<a href="#footnote693"><sup class="sml">693</sup></a> Conclusions are, according to their own contents
and end, either <i>Apodeictic</i>, which deal with necessary and
demonstrable matter, or <i>Dialectic</i>, which deal with
probable matter, or <i>Sophistical</i>, which are imperfect in
matter or form, and announced, deceptively,
as correct conclusions, when they are not. The doctrine
of Apodeictic conclusions is given in the "<i>Posterior
Analytic</i>," that of Dialectic conclusions in the
"<i>Topics</i>," and that of the Sophistical in the
"<i>Sophistical Elenchi</i>."</p>

<p>Now, if Logic is of any value as an instrument for the discovery
of truth, the attainment of certitude, it must teach us
not only how to deduce conclusions from premises, but it must
certify to us the validity of the principles from whence we
reason and this is attempted by Aristotle in the Posterior
Analytic. This treatise opens with the following statement: All
doctrine, and all intellectual discipline, arises from a prior or
pre-existent knowledge. This is evident, if we survey them
all; for both mathematical sciences, and also each of the arts,
are obtained in this manner. The same holds true in the case
of reasonings, whether through [deductive] <i>Syllogism</i> or
through <i>Induction</i>, for both accomplish the instruction
they afford from information previously known--the former
(syllogistic reasoning) receiving it, as it were, from the
traditions of the intelligent, the latter (inductive reasoning)
manifesting the universal through the light of the singular.<a id="footnotetag694" name="footnotetag694"></a>
<a href="#footnote694"><sup class="sml">694</sup></a>

logic.<a id="footnotetag695" name="footnotetag695"></a>

<p>Both these processes are based upon an <i>anterior</i> knowledge.
Demonstrative science must be from things true, first, immediate,
more known than, prior to, and the causes of, the conclusion,
for thus there will be the appropriate first principles of
whatever is demonstrated.<a id="footnotetag696" name="footnotetag696"></a>
<a href="#footnote696"><sup class="sml">696</sup></a> The first principles of demonstration,
the material of thought, must, consequently, be supplied
by some power or faculty of the mind other than that
which is engaged in generalization and deductive reasoning.
Whence, then, is this "anterior knowledge" derived, and what
tests or criteria have we of its validity?</p>

<p>1. In regard to deductive or syllogistic reasoning, the views
of Aristotle are very distinctly expressed.</p>

<p>Syllogistic reasoning "proceeds from generals to particulars."<a id="footnotetag697" name="footnotetag697"></a>
<a href="#footnote697"><sup class="sml">697</sup></a>
The general must therefore be supplied as the foundation
of the deductive reasoning. Whence, then, is this knowledge
of "the general" derived? The answer of Aristotle is
that the universal major proposition, out of which the conclusion
of the syllogism is drawn, <i>is itself necessarily the conclusion
of a previous induction, and mediately or immediately an inference</i>--a
collection from individual objects of sensation or of self-consciousness.
"Now," says he, "demonstration is from universals,
but induction from particulars. It is impossible, however,
to investigate universals except through induction, since
things which are said to be from abstraction will be known
only by induction."<a id="footnotetag698" name="footnotetag698"></a>
<a href="#footnote698"><sup class="sml">698</sup></a> It is thus clear that Aristotle makes <i>deduction
necessarily dependent upon induction</i>. He maintains that
the highest or most universal principles which constitute the
primary and immediate propositions of the former are furnished
by the latter.</p>

<p>2. General principles being thus furnished by induction, we
may now inquire whence, according to Aristotle, are the materials
for induction derived? What is the character of that "anterior
knowledge" which is the basis of the inductive process?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="398" >398</a></span>

<p>Induction, says Aristotle, is "the progression from singulars
to universals."<a id="footnotetag699" name="footnotetag699"></a>
<a href="#footnote699"><sup class="sml">699</sup></a> It is an illation of the universal from the singular
as legitimated by the laws of thought. All knowledge,
therefore, begins with singulars--that is, with individual objects.
And inasmuch as all knowledge begins with "individual
objects," and as the individual is constantly regarded by
Aristotle as the "object of sense," it is claimed that his doctrine
is that all knowledge is derived from <i>sensation</i>, and that
science and art result to man (<i>solely</i>) by means of <i>experience.</i>
He is thus placed at the head of the empirical school of philosophy,
as Plato is placed at the head of the ideal school.</p>

<p>This classification, however, is based upon a very superficial
acquaintance with the philosophy of Aristotle as a whole. The
practice, so commonly resorted to, of determining the character
of the Aristotelian philosophy by the light of one or two passages
quoted from his "Metaphysics," is unjust both to Aristotle
and to the history of philosophic thought. We can not
expect to attain a correct understanding of the views of Aristotle
concerning the sources and grounds of all knowledge
without some attention to his psychology. A careful study of
his writings will show that the terms "sensation" (αὶσθησις) and
"experience" (ἐµπειρία) are employed in a much more comprehensive
sense than is usual in modern philosophic writings.</p>

<p>"Sensation," in its lowest form, is defined by Aristotle as
"an excitation of the soul through the body,"<a id="footnotetag700" name="footnotetag700"></a>
<a href="#footnote700"><sup class="sml">700</sup></a> and, in its higher
form, as the excitation of the soul by any object of knowledge.
In this latter form it is used by him as synonymous with "intuition,"
and embraces all immediate intuitive perceptions,
whether of sense, consciousness, or reason. "The universe is
derived from particulars, therefore we ought to have a sensible
perception (αὶσθησις) of these; and this is intellect (νοῦς)."<a id="footnotetag701" name="footnotetag701"></a>
<a href="#footnote701"><sup class="sml">701</sup></a>

respects, a sense, because it is the source of a class of truths

revealed as facts to be received upon their own evidence. It
thus answers to the "sensus communis" of Cicero, and the
"Common Sense" of the Scottish school. Under this aspect,
"Sense is equal to or has the force of Science."<a id="footnotetag702" name="footnotetag702"></a>
<a href="#footnote702"><sup class="sml">702</sup></a> The term
"Experience" is also used to denote, not merely the perception
and remembrance of the impressions which external objects
make upon the mind, but as co-extensive with the whole contents
of consciousness--all that the mind <i>does</i> of its own native
energy, as well as all that it <i>suffers</i> from without. It is evidently
used in the Posterior Analytic (bk. ii. ch. xix.) to describe
the whole process by which the knowledge of universals
is obtained. "From experience, or from every universal remaining
in the soul, the principles of art and science arise."
The office of experience is "to furnish the principles of every
science"<a id="footnotetag703" name="footnotetag703"></a>
<a href="#footnote703"><sup class="sml">703</sup></a>--that is, to evoke them into energy in the mind.
'Experience thus seems to be a thing almost similar to science
and art.<a id="footnotetag704" name="footnotetag704"></a>
<a href="#footnote704"><sup class="sml">704</sup></a> In the most general sense, "sensation" would thus
appear to be the immediate perception or intuition of facts and
principles, and "experience" the operation of the mind upon
these facts and principles, elaborating them into scientific form
according to its own inherent laws. The "experience" of Aristotle
is analogous to the "reflection" of Locke.</p>

is a distinction perpetually recurring in the writings of Aristotle
between the elements or first principles of knowledge which
are "clearest in their own nature" and those which "are
clearest to our perception."<a id="footnotetag705" name="footnotetag705"></a>
<a href="#footnote705"><sup class="sml">705</sup></a> The causes or principles of

<p>The objects of sense-perception are external, individual,
"nearest to sense," and occasionally or contingently present to
sense. The objects of the intellect are inward, universal, and
the essential property of the soul. They are "remote from
sense," "prior by nature;" they are "forms" essentially inherent
in the soul previous to experience; and it is the office of
experience to bring them forward into the light of consciousness,
or, in the language of Aristotle, "to evoke them from potentiality
into actuality." And further, from the "prior" and
immediate intuitions of sense and intellect, all our secondary,
our scientific and practical knowledge is drawn by logical
processes.</p>

<p>The Aristotelian distribution of the intellectual faculties
corresponds fully to this division of the objects of knowledge.
The human intellect is divided by Aristotle into,</p>

<p>1. The Passive or Receptive Intellect (νοῦς παφητικός).--Its
office is the reception of sensible impressions or images
(Φαντάσµατα) and their retention in the mind (µνήµη).
These sensible forms or images are essentially immaterial.
"Each sensoriurn (αἰσθητήρων) is receptive of the sensible
quality <i>without the matter</i>, and hence when the sensibles
themselves are absent, sensations and φαντασίκός remain."<a id="footnotetag707" name="footnotetag707"></a>

name="footnote707"><b>Footnote 707: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag707">
(return) </a> "De Anima," bk. iii. ch. ii.</blockquote>

<p>2. The Active or Creative Intellect (νοῦς ποιητικός).--This is
the power or faculty which, by its own inherent power, impresses
"form" upon the material of thought supplied by
sense-perception, exactly as the First Cause combines it, in
the universe, with the recipient matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="401" >401</a></span></p>

<p>"It is necessary," says Aristotle, "that these two modes
should be opposed to each other, as matter is opposed to form,
and to all that gives form. The receptive reason, which is as
matter, becomes all things by receiving their forms. The creative
reason gives existence to all things, as light calls color
into being. The creative reason transcends the body, being
capable of separation from it, and from all things; it is an
everlasting existence, incapable of being mingled with matter,
or affected by it; prior, and subsequent to the individual mind.
The receptive reason is necessary to individual thought, but it
is perishable, and by its decay all memory, and therefore individuality,
is lost to the higher and immortal reason."<a id="footnotetag708" name="footnotetag708"></a>
<a href="#footnote708"><sup class="sml">708</sup></a></p>

<p>This "Active or Creative Intellect" is again further subdivided,
by Aristotle--</p>

<p>1. The <i>Scientific</i> (έπιστηµονικον) part--the "virtue," faculty,
or "habit of principles." He also designates it as the "place
of principles," and further defines it as the power "which
apprehends those existences whose principles can not be
otherwise than they are"--that is, self-evident, immutable,
and necessary truths<a id="footnotetag709" name="footnotetag709"></a>
<a href="#footnote709"><sup class="sml">709</sup></a>--the <i>intuitive reason</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Reasoning</i> (λογιστικόν) part--the power by which
we draw conclusions from premises, and "contemplate contingent
matter"<a id="footnotetag710" name="footnotetag710"></a>
<a href="#footnote710"><sup class="sml">710</sup></a>--the <i>discursive reason</i>.</p>

<p>The correlatives <i>noetic</i> and <i>dianoetic</i>, says Hamilton, would
afford the best philosophic designation of these two faculties;
the knowledge attained by the former is an "intuitive principle"--a
truth at first hand; that obtained by the latter is a
"demonstrative proposition"--a truth at second hand.</p>

<p>The preceding notices of the psychology of Aristotle will
aid us materially in interpreting his remarks "<i>Upon the Method
and Habits necessary to the ascertainment of Principles</i>."<a id="footnotetag711" name="footnotetag711"></a>

<p>"That it is impossible to have scientific knowledge through
demonstration without a knowledge of first immediate principles,
has been elucidated before." This being established, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="402" >402</a></span>
proceeds to explain how that "knowledge of first, immediate
principles" is developed in the mind.</p>

<p>1. The knowledge of first principles is attained by the <i>intuition
of sense</i>--the immediate perception of external objects, as
the <i>exciting</i> or <i>occasional cause</i> of their development in the mind.</p>

<p>"Now there appears inherent in all animals an innate power
called <i>sensible perception</i> (αἴσθησις); but sense being inherent,
in some animals a permanency of the sensible object is engendered,
but in others it is not engendered. Those, therefore,
wherein the sensible object does not remain have no knowledge
without sensible perception, but others, when they perceive,
retain one certain thing in the soul,... with some, <i>reason</i>
is produced from the permanency (of the sensible impression),
[as in man], but in others it is not [as in the brute].
From sense, therefore, as we say, memory is produced, and
from the repeated remembrance of the same thing we get experience....
From experience, or <i>from every universal remaining
in the soul</i>--the one besides the many which in all of them
is <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i>--the principles of art and science arise.
If experience is conversant with generation, the principles of
art; if with being, the principles of science.... Let us again
explain: When one thing without difference abides, there is
then the first universal (notion) [developed] in the soul; for
the singular indeed is perceived by sense, <i>but sense is [also] of
the universal</i>"--that is, the universal is immanent in the sensible
object as a property giving it "form." "It is manifest,
then, that primary things become necessarily known by induction,
for thus sensible perception produces [develops or evokes]
the <i>universal</i>."
2. The knowledge of first principles is attained by the <i>intuition
of pure intellect</i> (νοῦς)--that is, "<i>intellect itself is the principle
of science</i>" or, in other words, intellect is the <i>efficient, essential
cause</i> of the knowledge of first principles.</p>

<p>"Of those habits which are about intellect by which we ascertain
truth, <i>some</i><a id="footnotetag712" name="footnotetag712"></a>
<a href="#footnote712"><sup class="sml">712</sup></a> <i>are always true</i>, but others<a id="footnotetag713" name="footnotetag713"></a>
<a href="#footnote713"><sup class="sml">713</sup></a> admit the false,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="403" >403</a></span>
as opinion and reasoning. But science and (pure) intellect are
always true, and no other kind of knowledge, except intellect
[intellectual intuition], is more accurate than science. And
since the principles of demonstration are more known, and all
science is connected with reason, there could not be a science
of principles. But since nothing can be more true than science,
except intellect, intellect will belong to principles. From these
[considerations] it is evident that, as demonstration is not the
principle of demonstration, so neither is science the principle
of science. If, then, we have no other true genus (of habit) besides
science, <i>intellect will be the principle of science</i>; it will also
be the principle (or cause of the knowledge) of the principle."</p>

<p>The doctrine of Aristotle regarding "first principles" may
perhaps be summed up as follows: All demonstrative science
is based upon <i>universals</i> "prior in nature"--that is, upon <i>à
priori</i>, self-evident, necessary, and immutable principles. Our
knowledge of these "first and immediate principles" is dependent
primarily on <i>intellect</i> (νοῦς) or intuitive reason, and secondarily
on sense, experience, and induction. Prior to experience,
the intellect contains these principles in itself potentially, as
"forms," "laws," "habitudes," or "predicaments" of thought;
but they can not be "evoked into energy," can not be revealed
in consciousness, except on condition of experience, and they
can only be scientifically developed by logical abstraction and
definition. The ultimate ground of all truth and certainty is
thus a mode of our own mind, a subjective necessity of thinking,
and truth is not in things, but in our own minds.<a id="footnotetag714" name="footnotetag714"></a>
<a href="#footnote714"><sup class="sml">714</sup></a> "Ultimate
knowledge, as well as primary knowledge, the most perfect
knowledge which the philosopher can attain, as well as the
point from which he starts, is still a proposition. All knowledge
seems to be included under two forms--knowledge <i>that</i>
it is so; knowledge <i>why</i> it is so. Neither of these can, of
course, include the knowledge at which Plato is aiming--knowledge
which is correlated with Being--a knowledge, not <i>about</i>
things or persons, but <i>of</i> them."<a id="footnotetag715" name="footnotetag715"></a>

<p class="mid"><b>ARISTOTELIAN THEOLOGY</b></p>

<p>Theoretical philosophy, "the science which has truth for its
end," is divided by Aristotle into Physics, Mathematics, and
Theology, or the First Philosophy, now commonly known as
"Metaphysics," because it is beyond or above physics, and is
concerned with the primitive ground and cause of all things.<a id="footnotetag716" name="footnotetag716"></a>
<a href="#footnote716"><sup class="sml">716</sup></a></p>

<p>In the former two we have now no immediate interest, but
with Theology, as "the science of the Divine,"<a id="footnotetag717" name="footnotetag717"></a>
<a href="#footnote717"><sup class="sml">717</sup></a> the <i>First Moving
Cause</i>, which is the source of all other causes, and the original
ground of all other things, we are specially concerned, inasmuch
as our object is to determine, if possible, whether Greek
philosophy exerted any influence upon Christian thought, and
has bequeathed any valuable results to the Theology of modern
times.</p>

<p>"The Metaphysics" of Aristotle opens by an enumeration
of "the principles or causes"<a id="footnotetag718" name="footnotetag718"></a>
<a href="#footnote718"><sup class="sml">718</sup></a> into which all existences can be
resolved by philosophical analysis. This enumeration is at
present to be regarded as provisional, and in part hypothetical--a
verbal generalization of the different principles which seem
to be demanded to explain the existence of a thing, or constitute
it what it is. These he sets down as--</p>

there does. This transcendental and permanent substance, if it exist at all,
must surely be the sphere of the <i>divine</i>--it must be the first and highest

science--Physics, Mathematics, and Theology."--"Metaphysics," bk. x. ch. vii.</blockquote>

<p>1. The Material Cause (τὴν ὕλην καὶ τὸ ὑποκείµενον)--the matter
and subject--that <i>out of</i> which a given thing has been originated.
"From the analogy which this principle has to wood
or stone, or any actual matter out of which a work of nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="405">405</a></span>
or of art is produced, the name 'material' is assigned to this
class." It does not always necessarily mean "matter" in the
now common use of the term, but "antecedents--that is, principles
whose inherence and priority is implied in any existing
thing, as, for example, the premises of a syllogism, which are
the material cause of the conclusion."<a id="footnotetag719" name="footnotetag719"></a>
<a href="#footnote719"><sup class="sml">719</sup></a> With Aristotle there
is, therefore, "matter as an object of sense," and "matter as
an object of thought."</p>

<p>2. The Formal Cause (τὴν οὐσίαν καὶ τό τι εἶναι)--the being
or abstract essence of a thing--that primary nature on which
all its properties depend. To this Aristotle gave the name of
εἶδος--the form or exemplar <i>according to</i> which a thing is produced.</p>

<p>3. The Moving or Efficient Cause (ὃθεν ἦ ἆρχη τῆς κινήσεως)--the
origin and principle of motion--that <i>by which</i> a thing is
produced.</p>

<p>4. The Final Cause (τὸ οὗ ἕνεκεν καὶ τὸ ἀγαθόν)--the good
end answered by the existence of any thing--that for the sake

<a href="#footnote720"><sup class="sml">720</sup></a>
Thus, for instance, in a house, the wood out of which it is produced
is the matter (ὕλη), the idea or conception according to
which it is produced is <i>the form</i> (εἶδος῏῏µορφή), the builder who
erects the house is the <i>efficient</i> cause, and the reason for its production,
or the end of its existence is the <i>final</i> cause.</p>

<p>Causes are, therefore, the elements into which the mind resolves
its first rough conception of an object. That object
is what it is, by reason of the matter out of which it sprang,
the moving cause which gave it birth, the idea or form which
it realizes, and the end or object which it attains. The knowledge
of a thing implies knowing it from these four points of
view--that is, knowing its four causes or principles.</p>

<p>These four determinations of being are, on a further and
closer analysis, resolved into the fundamental antithesis of
MATTER and FORM.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="406" >406</a></span></p>

<p>"All things that are produced," says Aristotle,<a id="footnotetag721" name="footnotetag721"></a>
<a href="#footnote721"><sup class="sml">721</sup></a> "are produced
from something (that is, from <i>matter</i>), by something (that
is, <i>form</i>), and become something (the totality--τὸ σύνολον);" as,
for example, a statue, a plant, a man. To every subject there
belongs, therefore, first, <i>matter</i> (ὕλη); secondly, <i>form</i> (µορφή).
The synthesis of these two produces and constitutes <i>substance</i>,
or οὐσία. Matter and form are thus the two grand causes or
principles whence proceed all things. The formative cause is,
at the same time, the moving cause and the final cause; for
it is evidently the element of determination which impresses
movement upon matter whilst determining it; and it is also
the end of being, since being only really exists when it has
passed from an indeterminate to a determinate state.</p>

name="footnote721"><b>Footnote 721: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag721">
(return) </a> "Metaphysics," bk. vi. ch. vii.</blockquote>

<p>In proof that the εἶδος or form is an <i>efficient</i> principle operating
in every object, which makes it, to our conception, what it
is, Aristotle brings forward the subject of generation or production.<a id="footnotetag722" name="footnotetag722"></a>
<a href="#footnote722"><sup class="sml">722</sup></a>
There are three modes of production--natural, artificial,
and automatic. In natural production we discern at once
a matter; indeed Nature, in the largest sense, may be defined
as "that out of which things are produced." Now the result
formed out of this matter or nature is a given substance--a
vegetable, a beast, or a man. But what is the <i>producing</i> cause
in each case? Clearly something akin to the result. A man
generates a man, a plant produces another plant like to itself.
There is, therefore, implied in the resulting thing a <i>productive
force</i> distinct from matter, upon which it works. And this is
the εἶδος, or form. Let us now consider artificial production.
Here again the form is the producing power. And this is in
the soul. The art of the physician is the εἶδος, which produces
actual health; the plan of the architect is the conception, which
produces an actual house. Here, however, a distinction arises.
In these artificial productions there is supposed a νόησις and a
ποίησις. The νόησις is the previous conception which the architect
forms in his own mind; the ποίησις is the actual creation
of the house out of the given matter. In this case the conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="407">407</a></span>
is the moving cause of the production. The form of the
statue in the mind of the artist is the motive or cause of the
movement by which the statue is produced; and health must
be in the thought of the physician before it can become the
moving cause of the healing art. Moreover, that which is true
of artificial production or change is also true of spontaneous
production. For example, a cure may take place by the application
of warmth, and this result is accomplished by means of
friction. This warmth in the body is either itself a portion of
health, or something is consequent upon it which is like itself,
which is a portion of health. Evidently this implies the previous
presence either of nature or of an artificer. It is also
clearly evident that this kind of generating influence (the automatic)
should combine with another. There must be a productive
power, and there must be something out of which it
is produced. In this case, then, there will be a ὕλη and an
εἶδος.<a id="footnotetag723" name="footnotetag723"></a>

<p>From the above it appears that the <i>efficient</i> cause is regarded
by Aristotle as identical with the <i>formal</i> cause. So also the
<i>final</i> cause--the end for the sake of which any thing exists--can
hardly be separated from the perfection of that thing, that
is, from its conception or form. The desire for the end gives
the first impulse of motion; thus the final cause of any thing
becomes identical with the good of that thing. "The moving
cause of the house is the builder, but the moving cause of the
builder is the end to be attained--that is, the house." From
such examples as these it would seem that the determinations
of form and end are considered by Aristotle as one, in so far
as both are merged in the conception of <i>actuality</i>; for he regarded
the end of every thing to be its completed being--the
perfect realization of its idea or form. The only fundamental
determinations, therefore, which can not be wholly resolved
into each other are <i>matter and form</i>.<a id="footnotetag724" name="footnotetag724"></a>

<p>The opposition of matter and form, with Aristotle, corresponds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="408" >408</a></span>
to the opposition between the element of <i>generality</i> and
the element of <i>particularity</i>. Matter is indeterminate; form is
determinate. Matter, abstracted from form, in thought, is entirely
without predicate and distinction; form is that which
enters into the definition of every subject, and without which it
could not be defined. Matter is capable of the widest diversity
of forms, but is itself without form. Pure form is, in fact,
that which is without matter, or, in other words, it is the pure
conception of being. Matter is the necessary condition of the
existence of a thing; form is the essence of each thing, that in
virtue of which substance is possible, and without which it is
inconceivable. On the one side is passivity, possibility of existence,
capacity of action; on the other side is activity, actuality,
thought. The unity of these two in the realm of determined
being constitutes every individual substance. The relation
of matter and form, logically apprehended, is thus the relation
of POTENTIALITY and ACTUALITY.</p>

<p>This is a further and indeed a most important step in the
Aristotelian theology. Matter, as we have seen, after all,
amounts to merely capacity for action, and if we can not discover
some productive power to develop potentiality into actuality,
we look in vain for some explanation of the phenomena
around us. The discovery, however, of energy (ἐνέργεια), as a
principle of this description, is precisely what we wanted, and a
momentary glance at the actual phenomena will show its perfect
identity with the εἶδος, or form.<a id="footnotetag725" name="footnotetag725"></a>
<a href="#footnote725"><sup class="sml">725</sup></a> "For instance, what is a
calm? It is evenness in the surface of the sea. Here the sea
is the subject, that is, the matter in <i>capacity</i>, but the evenness
is the <i>energy</i> or actuality;... energy is thus as form."<a id="footnotetag726" name="footnotetag726"></a>
<a href="#footnote726"><sup class="sml">726</sup></a> The
form (or idea) is thus an energy or actuality (ἐνέργεια); the</p>

<p>matter is a capacity or potentiality (δύναµις), requiring the co-operation
of the energy to produce a result.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="409">409</a></span>
These terms, which are first employed by Aristotle in their
philosophical signification, are characteristic of his whole system.
It is, therefore, important we should grasp their precise
philosophical import; and this can only be done by considering
them in the strictest relation to each other. It is in this relation
they are defined by Aristotle. "Now ἐνέργεια is the existence
of a thing not in the sense of its potentially existing.
The term <i>potentially</i> we use, for instance, of the statue in the
block, and of the half in the whole (since it may be subtracted),
and of a person knowing a thing, even when he is not thinking
of it, but might be so; whereas ἐνέργεια is the opposite. By
applying the various instances our meaning will be plain, and
one must not seek a definition in each case, but rather grasp
the conception of the analogy as a whole,--that it is as that
which builds to that which has a capacity for building; as the
waking to the sleeping; as that which sees to that which has
sight, but whose eyes are closed; as the definite form to the
shapeless matter; as the complete to the unaccomplished. In
this contrast, let the ἐνέργεια be set off as forming the one side,
and on the other let the potential stand. Things are said to
be in ἐνέργεια not always in like manner (except so far as there
is an analogy, that as this thing is in this, and related to this,
so is that in that, or related to that); for sometimes it implies
<i>motion</i> as opposed to the <i>capacity of motion</i>, and sometimes <i>complete
existence</i> opposed to <i>undeveloped matter</i>".<a id="footnotetag727" name="footnotetag727"></a>
<a href="#footnote727"><sup class="sml">727</sup></a> As the term
δύναµις has the double meaning of "<i>possibility of existence</i>" as
well as "<i>capacity of action</i>" so there is the double contrast of
"<i>action</i>" as opposed to the capacity of action; and "<i>actual existence</i>"
opposed to possible existence or potentiality. To express
accurately this latter antithesis, Aristotle introduced the term
ἐντελέχεια<a id="footnotetag728" name="footnotetag728"></a>
<a href="#footnote728"><sup class="sml">728</sup></a>--entelechy, of which the most natural account is
that it is a compound of ἐν τέλει ἔχειν--"being in a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="410">410</a></span>
perfection."<a id="footnotetag729" name="footnotetag729"></a>
<a href="#footnote729"><sup class="sml">729</sup></a> This term, however, rarely occurs in the "Metaphysics,"
whilst ἐνέργεια is everywhere employed, not only to
express activity as opposed to passivity, but complete existence
as opposed to undeveloped matter.</p>

<p>"In Physics δύναµις answers to the necessary conditions for
the existence of any thing before that thing exists. It thus
corresponds to ὕλη, both to the πρώτη ὕλη--the first matter, or
matter devoid of all qualities, which is capable of becoming
any definite substance, as, for example, marble; and also to
the ἐσχάτη ὕλη--or matter capable of receiving form, as marble
the form of the statue." Marble then exists potentially in the
simple elements before it is marble. The statue exists potentially
in the marble before it is carved. All objects of thought
exist, either purely in potentiality, or purely in actuality, or
both in potentiality and in actuality. This division makes an
entire chain of all existence. At the one end is matter, the
πρώτη ὕλη which has a merely potential existence, which is
necessary as a condition, but which having no form and no
qualities, is totally incapable of being realized by the mind.
At the other end of the chain is pure form, which is not at all
matter, the absolute and the unconditioned, the eternal substance
and energy without matter (οὐσία ἀίδιος καὶ ἐνέργεια ἄνευ
δυνάµεως), who can not be thought as non-existing--the self-existent
God. Between these two extremes is the whole row
of creatures, which out of potentiality evermore spring into

<p>The relation of actuality to potentiality is the subject of an
extended and elaborate discussion in book viii., the general results
of which may be summed up in the following propositions:</p>

<p>1. <i>The relation of Actuality to Potentiality is as the Perfect to
the Imperfect</i>.--The progress from potentiality to actuality is
motion or production (κίνησις or γένεσις). But this motion is
transitional, and in itself imperfect--it tends towards an end,
but does not include the end in itself. But actuality, if it implies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="411">411</a></span>
motion, has an end in itself and for itself; it is a motion desirable
for its own sake.<a id="footnotetag731" name="footnotetag731"></a>
<a href="#footnote731"><sup class="sml">731</sup></a> The relation of the potential to the
actual Aristotle exhibits by the relation of the unfinished to
the finished work, of the unemployed builder to the one at
work upon his building, of the seed-corn to the tree, of the man
who has the capacity to think, to the man actually engaged in
thought.<a id="footnotetag732" name="footnotetag732"></a>
<a href="#footnote732"><sup class="sml">732</sup></a> Potentially the seed-corn is the tree, but the grown-up
tree is the actuality; the potential philosopher is he who is
not at this moment in a philosophic condition; indeed, every
thing is potential which possesses a principle of development,
or of change. Actuality or entelechy, on the other hand, indicates
the <i>perfect act</i>, the end gained, the completed actual; that
activity in which the act and the completeness of the act fall
together--as, for example, to see, to think, where the acting
and the completed act are one and the same.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Relation of Actuality to Potentiality is a causal Relation</i>.--A
thing which is endued with a simple capacity of being
may nevertheless not actually exist, and a thing may have a
capacity of being and really exist. Since this is the case, there
must ensue between non-being and real being some such principle
as <i>energy</i>, in order to account for the transition or change.<a id="footnotetag733" name="footnotetag733"></a>
<a href="#footnote733"><sup class="sml">733</sup></a>
Energy has here some analogy to motion, though it must not
be confounded with motion. Now you can not predicate either
motion or energy of things which are not. The moment energy
is added to them they are. This transition from potentiality
to actuality must be through the medium of such principles as
propension or <i>free will</i>, because propension or free will possess
in themselves the power of originating motion in other things.<a id="footnotetag734" name="footnotetag734"></a>

<p>3. <i>The Relation of Actuality and Potentiality is a Relation of
Priority</i>.--Actuality, says Aristotle, is prior to potentiality in
the order of reason, in the order of substance, and also (though
not invariably) in the order of time. The first of all capacities
is a capacity of energizing or assuming a state of activity; for
example, a man who has the capacity of building is one who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="412">412</a></span>
skilled in building, and thus able to use his energy in the art
of building.<a id="footnotetag735" name="footnotetag735"></a>
<a href="#footnote735"><sup class="sml">735</sup></a> The primary energizing power must precede that
which receives the impression of it, Form being older than
Matter. But if you take the case of any particular person or
thing, we say that its capacity of being that particular person
or thing precedes its being so actually. Yet, though this is the
case in each particular thing, there is always a foregone energy
presumed in some other thing (as a prior seed, plant, man) to
which it owes its existence. One pregnant thought presents
itself in the course of the discussion which has a direct bearing
upon our subject. Δὑναµιϛ has been previously defined as "a
principle of motion or change in another thing in so far forth as
it is another thing"<a id="footnotetag736" name="footnotetag736"></a>
<a href="#footnote736"><sup class="sml">736</sup></a>--that is, it is fitted by nature to have motion
imparted to it, and to communicate motion to something
else. But this motion wants a resting-place. There can be
no infinite regression of causes. There is some primary δύναµιϛ
presupposed in all others, which is the beginning of change.
This is Φύσις, or nature. But the first and original cause of all
motion and change still precedes and surpasses nature. The
final cause of all potentiality is energy or <i>actuality</i>. The one
proposed is prior to the means through which the end is accomplished.
A process of actualization, a tendency towards
completeness or perfection (τέλοϛ) presupposes an absolute
actuality which is at once its beginning and end. "One energy
is invariably antecedent to another in time, up to that which
is primarily and eternally the Moving Cause."<a id="footnotetag737" name="footnotetag737"></a>

<p>And now having laid down these fundamental principles
of metaphysical science, as preparatory to Theology, Aristotle
proceeds to establish the conception of the Absolute or Divine
Spirit <i>as the eternal, immutable Substance, the immaterial
Energy, the unchangeable Form of Forms, the first moving Cause</i>.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Ontological Form of Proof</i>.--It is necessary to conceive
an eternal and immutable substance--an actuality which
is absolute and prior, both logically and chronologically, to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="413" >4713</a></span>
potentiality; for that which is potential is simply contingent,
it may just as easily not be as be; that which exists only in
capacity is temporal and corruptible, and may cease to be.
Matter we know subsists merely in capacity and passivity, and
without the operation of Energy, (ἐνέργεια), or the formative
cause, would be to us as non-entity. The phenomena of the
world exhibits to us the presence of Energy, and energy presupposes
the existence of an eternal substance. Furthermore,
matter and potentiality are convertible terms, therefore the primal
Energy or Actuality must be <i>immaterial</i>.<a id="footnotetag738" name="footnotetag738"></a>
<a href="#footnote738"><sup class="sml">738</sup></a></p>

<p>2. <i>The Cosmological Form of Proof</i>.--It is impossible that
there should be <i>motion</i>, genesis, or a chain of causes, except on
the assumption of a first Moving Cause, since that which exists
only in capacity can not, of itself energize, and consequently
without a principle of motion which is essentially active,
we have only a principle of immobility. The principle
"ex nihilo nihil" forbids us to assume that motion can arise
out of immobility, being out of non-being. "How can matter
be put in motion if nothing that subsists in energy exist, and
is its cause?" All becoming, therefore, necessarily supposes
that which has not become, that which is eternally self-active
as the principle and cause of all motion. There is no refuge
from the notion that all things are "born of night and nothingness"
except in this belief.<a id="footnotetag739" name="footnotetag739"></a>

<p>The existence of an eternal principle subsisting in energy
is also demanded to explain the <i>order</i> of the world. "For
how, let me ask, will there prevail <i>order</i> on the supposition
that there is no subsistence of that which is eternal, and which
involves a separable existence, and is permanent."<a id="footnotetag740" name="footnotetag740"></a>

<a href="#footnote742"><sup class="sml">742</sup></a> Now an end or
final cause presupposes intelligence,--implies a <i>mind</i> to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="414">414</a></span>
and desire it. That which is "fair," "beautiful," "good," an
"object of desire," can only be perceived by Mind. The

<p>3. <i>The Moral Form of Proof</i>.--So far as the relation of potentiality
and actuality is identical with the relation of matter
and form, the argument for the existence of God may be thus
presented: The conception of an absolute matter without form,
involves the supposition of an absolute form without matter.
And since the conception of form resolves itself into <i>motion</i>,
<i>conception</i>, <i>purpose</i> or <i>end</i>, so the Eternal One is the absolute
principle of motion (the πρῶτον κινοῦν), the absolute conception
or pure intelligence (the pure τί ἦν εἶναι), and the absolute
ground, reason, or end of all being. All the other predicates
of the First Cause follow from the above principles with logical
necessity.</p>

<p>(i.) <i>He is, of course, pure intellect</i>, because he is absolutely
immaterial and free from nature. He is active intelligence,
because his essence is pure actuality. He is self-contemplating
and self-conscious intelligence, because the divine thought
can not attain its actuality in any thing extrinsic; it would depend
on something else than self--some potential existence
for its actualization. Hence the famous definition of the absolute
as "the thought of thought" (νόησις νοήσεως).<a id="footnotetag745" name="footnotetag745"></a>

<p>(ii.) <i>He is also essential life</i>. "The principle of life is inherent
in the Deity, for the energy or active exercise of mind
constitutes life, and God constitutes this energy; and essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="415">415</a></span>
energy belongs to God as his best and everlasting life. Now

<p>(v.) <i>He is the ever-blessed God</i>.--"The life of God is of a
kind with those highest moods which, with us, last a brief space,
it being impossible they should be permanent; whereas, with
Him they are permanent, since His ever-present consciousness
is pleasure itself. And it is because they are vivid states of
consciousness, that waking, and perception, and thought, are
the sweetest of all things. Now essential perception is the
perception of that which is most excellent,... and the mind
perceives itself by participating of its own object of perception;
but it is a sort of coalescence of both that, in the Divine Mind,
creates a regular identity between the two, so that with God
both (the thinker and the thought, the subject and object) are
the same. In possession of this prerogative, He subsists in
the exercise of energy; and the contemplation of his own perfections
is what, to God, must be most agreeable and excellent.
This condition of existence, after so excellent a manner, is what

<p>The theology of Aristotle may be summed up in the following
sentences selected from book xi. of his "Metaphysics:"</p>

<p>"This motionless cause of motion is a necessary being; and,
by virtue of such necessity, is the all-perfect being. This all-pervading
principle penetrates heaven and all nature. It eternally
possesses perfect happiness; and its happiness is in
action. This primal mover is immaterial; for its essence is
in energy. It is pure thought--thought thinking itself--the
thought of thought. The activity of pure intelligence--such is
the perfect, eternal life of God. This primal cause of change,
this absolute perfection, moves the world by the universal desire
for the absolute good, by the attraction exercised upon it by
the Eternal Mind--the serene energy of Divine Intelligence."</p>

<p>It can not be denied that, so far as it goes, this conception
of the Deity is admirable, worthy, and just. Viewed from a
Christian stand-point, we at once concede that it is essentially
defective. There is no clear and distinct recognition of God
as Creator and Governor of the universe; he is chiefly regarded
as the Life of the universe--the Intellect, the Energy--that
which gives excellence, and perfection, and gladness to the
whole system of things. The Theology of Aristotle is, in fact,
metaphysical rather than practical. He does not contemplate
the Deity as a moral Governor. Whilst Plato speaks of "being
made like God through becoming just and holy," Aristotle
asserts that "all moral virtues are totally unworthy of being
ascribed to God."<a id="footnotetag753" name="footnotetag753"></a>
<a href="#footnote753"><sup class="sml">753</sup></a> He is not the God of providence. He
dwells alone, supremely indifferent to human cares, and interests,
and sorrows. He takes no cognizance of individual men,
and holds no intercourse with man. The God of Aristotle is
not a being that meets and satisfies the wants of the human
heart, however well it may meet the demands of the reason.</p>

<p>Morality has no basis in the Divine nature, no eternal type in
the perfections and government of God, and no supports and
aids from above. The theology of Aristotle foreshadows the
character of the</p>

<p class="mid"><b>ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS.</b></p>

<p>We do not find in Aristotle any distinct recognition of an
eternal and immutable morality, an absolute right, which has
its foundation in the nature of God. Plato had taught that
there was "an absolute Good, above and beyond all existence
in dignity and power;" which is, in fact, "the cause of all existence
and all knowledge," and which is God; that all other
things are good in proportion as they "partake of this absolute
Good;" and that all men are so far good as they "resemble
God." But with this position Aristotle joins issue. After
stating the doctrine of Plato in the following words--"Some
have thought that, besides all these manifold goods upon earth,
there is some <i>absolute good</i>, which is the cause to all these of
their being good"--he proceeds to criticise that idea, and
concludes his argument by saying--"we must dismiss the
idea at present, for if there is any one good, universal and
generic, or transcendental and absolute, it obviously can never
be realized nor possessed by man; whereas something of this
latter kind is what we are inquiring after." He follows up
these remarks by saying that "Perhaps the knowledge of the
idea may be regarded by some as useful, as a pattern (παράδειγµα)
by which to judge of relative good." Against this he
argues that "There is no trace of the arts making use of any
such conception; the cobbler, the carpenter, the physician, and
the general, all pursue their vocations without respect to the <i>absolute
good</i>, nor is it easy to see how they would be benefited by
apprehending it."<a id="footnotetag754" name="footnotetag754"></a><a href="#footnote754"><sup class="sml">754</sup></a> The good after which Aristotle would inquire
is, therefore, a <i>relative good</i>, since the knowledge of the
absolute good can not possibly be realized.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of seeking to attain to "a transcendental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="418" >418</a></span>
and absolute good "--a fundamental idea of right, which may
be useful as a paradigm by which we may judge of relative
good, he addresses himself solely to the question, "what is
good for man"--what is the good attainable in action? And
having identified the Chief Good with the final and perfect end
of all action, the great question of the <i>Ethics</i> is, "<i>What is the
end of human action?</i>" (τί ἐστι τὸ τῶν πρακτῶν τέλος).<a id="footnotetag755" name="footnotetag755"></a>

<p>Now an end or final cause implies an intelligence--implies
a mind to perceive and desire it. This is distinctly recognized
by Aristotle. The question, therefore, naturally arises--is that
end fixed for man by a higher intelligence, and does it exist for
man both as an idea and as an ideal? Can man, first, intellectually
apprehend the idea, and then consciously strive after its
realization? Is it the duty of man to aim at fulfilling the purposes
of his Creator? To this it may be answered that Aristotle
is not at all explicit as to God's moral government of the
world. "Moral government," in the now common acceptation
of the term, has no place in the system of Aristotle, and the
idea of "duty" is scarcely recognized. He considers "the
good" chiefly in relation to the constitution and natural condition
of man. "<i>It is</i>" says he, "<i>the end towards which nature
tends</i>." As physical things strive unconsciously after the end
of their existence, so man strives after the good attainable in
life. Socrates had identified virtue and knowledge, he had
taught that "virtue is a Science." Aristotle contended that
virtue is an art, like music and architecture, which must be attained
by exercise. It is not purely intellectual, it is the bloom
of the physical, which has become ethical. As the flower of
the field, obeying the laws of its organization, springs up,
blooms, and attains its own peculiar perfection, so there is an
instinctive desire (ὄρεξις) in the soul which at first unconsciously
yearns after the good, and subsequently the good is sought
with full moral intent and insight. Aristotle assumes that the
desires or instincts of man are so framed as to imply the existence
of this end (τέλος).<a id="footnotetag756" name="footnotetag756"></a>
<a href="#footnote756"><sup class="sml">756</sup></a> And he asserts that man can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="419" >419</a></span>
realize it in the sphere of his own proper functions, and in accordance
with the laws of his own proper nature and its harmonious
development.<a id="footnotetag757" name="footnotetag757"></a>
<a href="#footnote757"><sup class="sml">757</sup></a> It is not, then, through instruction, or
through the perfection of knowledge, that man is to attain the
good, but through exercise and habit (ἔθος). By practice of
moral acts we become virtuous, just as by practice of building
and of music, we become architects and musicians; for the
habit, which is the ground of moral character, is only a fruit of
oft-repeated moral acts. Hence it is by these three things--nature,
habit, reason--that men become good.</p>

<p>Aristotle's question, therefore, is, <i>What is the chief good for
man as man</i>? not what is his chief good as a spiritual and an
immortal being? or what is his chief good as a being related to
and dependent upon God? And the conclusion at which he
arrives is, that it is <i>the absolute satisfaction of our whole nature</i>--that
which men are agreed in calling <i>happiness</i>. This happiness,
however, is not mere sensual pleasure. The brute shares
this in common with man, therefore it can not constitute the
happiness of man. Human happiness must express the completeness
of rational existence. And inasmuch as intelligence
is essential activity, as the soul is the <i>entelechy</i> of the body,
therefore the happiness of man can not consist in a mere passive
condition. It must, therefore, consist in <i>perfect activity</i> in
well-doing, and especially in contemplative thought,<a id="footnotetag758" name="footnotetag758"></a>
<a href="#footnote758"><sup class="sml">758</sup></a> or as Aristotle
defines it--"<i>It is a perfect practical activity in a perfect
life</i>."<a id="footnotetag759" name="footnotetag759"></a>
<a href="#footnote759"><sup class="sml">759</sup></a> His conception of the chief good has thus two sides,
one internal, that which exists in and for the consciousness--a
"complete and perfect life," the other external and practical.
The latter, however, is a means to the former. That complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="420">420</a></span>
and perfect life is the complete satisfaction and perfection of
our rational nature. It is a state of peace which is the crown
of exertion. It is the realization of the divine in man, and constitutes
the absolute and all-sufficient happiness.<a id="footnotetag760" name="footnotetag760"></a>
<a href="#footnote760"><sup class="sml">760</sup></a> A good action
is thus an End-in-itself (τέλειον τέλος) inasmuch as it secures
the <i>perfection</i> of our nature; it is that for the sake of which
our moral faculties before existed, hence bringing an inward
pleasure and satisfaction with it; something in which the mind
can rest and fully acquiesce; something which can be pronounced
beautiful, fitting, honorable, and perfect.</p>

<p>From what has been already stated, it will be seen that the
Aristotelian conception of <i>Virtue</i> is not conformity to an absolute
and immutable standard of right. It is defined by him as
<i>the observation of the right mean (µεσότης) in action</i>--that is, the
right mean relatively to ourselves. "Virtue is a habit deliberately
choosing, existing as a mean (µέσον) which refers to us,
and is defined by reason, and as a prudent man would define
it; and it is a mean between two evils, the one consisting in
excess, the other in defect; and further, it is a mean, in that
one of these falls short of, and the other exceeds, what is right
both in passions and actions; and that virtue both finds and
chooses the mean."<a id="footnotetag761" name="footnotetag761"></a>
<a href="#footnote761"><sup class="sml">761</sup></a> The perfection of an action thus consists
in its containing the right degree--the true mean between too
much, and too little. The law of the µεσότης is illustrated by
the following examples: Man has a fixed relation to pleasure
and pain. In relation to pain, the true mean is found in neither
fearing it nor courting it, and this is <i>fortitude</i>. In relation
to pleasure, the true mean stands between greediness and indifference;
this is <i>temperance</i>. The true mean between prodigality
and narrowness is <i>liberality</i>; between simplicity and cunning
is <i>prudence</i>; between suffering wrong and doing wrong is
<i>justice</i>. Extending this law to certain qualifications of temper,
speech, and manners, you have the portrait of a graceful Grecian
gentleman. Virtue is thus <i>proportion, grace, harmony,
beauty in action</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="421">421</a></span>

<p>It will at once be seen that this classification has no stable
foundation. It furnishes no ultimate standard of right. The
<i>mean</i> is a wavering line. It differs under different circumstances
and relations, and in different times and places. That mean
which is sufficient for one individual is insufficient for another.
The virtue of a man, of a slave, and of a child, is respectively
different. There are as many virtues as there are circumstances
in life; and as men are ever entering into new relations, in
which it is difficult to determine the correct method of action,
the separate virtues can not be limited to any definite number.</p>

<p>Imperfect as the ethical system of Aristotle may appear to
us who live in Christian times, it must be admitted that his
writings abound with just and pure sentiments. His science
of Ethics is a <i>discipline of human character in order to human
happiness</i>. And whilst it must be admitted that it is directed
solely to the improvement of man in the present life, he aims
to build that improvement on pure and noble principles, and
seeks to elevate man to the highest perfection of which he
could conceive. "And no greater praise can be given to a
work of heathen morality than to say, as may be said of the
ethical writings of Aristotle, that they contain nothing which a
Christian may dispense with, no precept of life which is not an
element of Christian character; and that they only fail in elevating
the heart and the mind to objects which it needed Divine
Wisdom to reveal."<a id="footnotetag762" name="footnotetag762"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ATHENS <i>(continued)</i></h3>

<h3>POST-SOCRATIC SCHOOL.</h3>

<h3>EPICURUS AND ZENO.</h3>

<p>Philosophy, after the time of Aristotle, takes a new
direction. In the pre-Socratic schools, we have seen it
was mainly a philosophy of nature; in the Socratic school it
was characterized as a philosophy of mind; and now in the
post-Socratic schools it becomes a philosophy of life--a moral
philosophy. Instead of aiming at the knowledge of real Being--of
the permanent, unchangeable, eternal principles which
underlie all phenomena, it was now content to aim, chiefly, at
individual happiness. The primary question now discussed, as
of the most vital importance, is, What is the ultimate standard
by which, amid all the diversities of human conduct and opinion,
we may determine what is right and good in individual
and social life?</p>

<p>This remarkable change in the course of philosophic inquiry
was mainly due--</p>

<p>1st. <i>To the altered circumstances of the times</i>. An age of civil
disturbance and political intrigue succeeded the Alexandrian
period. The different states of Greece lost their independence,
and became gradually subject to a foreign yoke. Handed over
from one domination to another, in the struggles of Alexander's
lieutenants, they endeavored to reconquer their independence
by forming themselves into confederations, but were powerless
to unite in the defense of a common cause. The Achæan and
Etolian leagues were weakened by internal discords; and it
was in vain that Sparta tried to recover her ancient liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="423">423</a></span></p>

<p>Divided amongst themselves, the smaller states invoked the
aid of dangerous allies--at one time appealing to Macedon, at
another to Egypt. In this way they prepared for the total
ruin of Greek liberty, which was destined to be extinguished by
Rome.<a id="footnotetag763" name="footnotetag763"></a>

(return) </a> Pressensé, "Religions before Christ," pp. 136-140.</blockquote>

<p>During this period of hopeless turmoil and social disorder,
all lofty pursuits and all great principles were lost sight of and
abandoned. The philosophic movement followed the downward
course of society, and men became chiefly concerned for
their personal interest and safety. The wars of the Succession
almost obliterated the idea of society, and philosophy was
mainly directed to the securing of personal happiness; it became,
in fact, "the art of making one's self happy." The sad
reverses to which the Grecian mind had been subjected produced
a feeling of exhaustion and indifference, which soon reflected
itself in the philosophy of the age.</p>

<p>2d. In connection with the altered circumstances of the age,
we must also take account of <i>the apparent failure of the Socratic
method to solve the problem of Being</i>.</p>

<p>The teaching of Aristotle had fostered the suspicion that
the dialectic method was a failure, and thus prepared the way
for a return to sensualism. He had taught that individuals
alone have a real existence, and that the "essence" of things
is not to be sought in the elements of unity and generality, or
in the <i>idea</i>, as Plato taught, but in the elements of diversity
and speciality. And furthermore, in opposition to Plato, he
had taught his disciples to attach themselves to sensation, as
the source of all knowledge. As the direct consequence of
this teaching, we find his immediate successors, Dicearchus
and Straton, deliberately setting aside "the god of philosophy,"
affirming "that a <i>divinity</i> was unnecessary to the explanation
of the existence and order of the universe." Stimulated by the
social degeneracy of the times, the characteristic skepticism of
the Greek intellect bursts forth anew. As the skepticism of
the Sophists marked the close of the first period of philosophy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="424" >424</a></span>
so the skepticism of Pyrrhonism marked the close of the
second. The new skepticism arrayed Aristotle against Plato
as the earlier skeptics arrayed atomism against the doctrine of
the Eleatics. They naturally said: "We have been seeking a
long time; what have we gained? Have we obtained any
thing certain and determinate? Plato says we have. But
Aristotle and Plato do not agree. May not our opinion be as
good as theirs? What a diversity of opinions have been presented
during the past three hundred years! One may be as
good as another, or they may be all alike untrue!" Timon
and Pyrrhon declared that, of each thing, it might be said to
be, and not to be; and that, consequently, we should cease tormenting
ourselves, and seek to obtain an <i>absolute calm</i>, which
they dignified with the name of <i>ataraxie</i>. Beholding the overthrow
and disgrace of their country, surrounded by examples
of pusillanimity and corruption, and infected with the spirit of
the times themselves, they wrote this maxim: "Nothing is infamous;
nothing is in itself just; laws and customs alone constitute
what is justice and what is iniquity." Having reached
this extreme, nothing can be too absurd, and they cap the climax
by saying, "We assert nothing; no, not even that we assert
nothing!"</p>

<p>And yet there must some function, undoubtedly, remain for
the "wise man" (σοφός).</p>

<p>Reason was given for some purpose. Philosophy must have
some end. And inasmuch as it is not to determine speculative
questions, it must be to determine practical questions.
May it not teach men to <i>act</i> rather than to <i>think</i>? The philosopher,
the schools, the disciples, survive the darkening flood of
skepticism.</p>

<p>Three centuries before Christ, the Peripatetic and Platonic
schools are succeeded by two other schools, which inherit their
importance, and which, in other forms, and by an under-current,
perpetuate the disputes of the Peripatetics and Platonists,
namely, the Epicureans and Stoics. With Aristotle and Plato,
philosophy embraced in its circle nature, humanity, and God;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="425">425</a></span>
but now, in the systems of Epicurus and Zeno, moral philosophy
is placed in the foreground, and assumes the chief, the
overshadowing pre-eminence. The conduct of life--morality--is
now the grand subject of inquiry, and the great theme of
discourse.</p>

<p>In dealing with <i>morals</i> two opposite methods of inquiry were
possible:</p>

<p>1. <i>To judge of the quality of actions by their</i> RESULTS.</p>

<p>2. <i>To search for the quality of actions in the actions them
selves</i>.</p>

<p>Utility, which in its last analysis is <i>Pleasure</i>, is the test of
right, in the first method; an assumed or discovered <i>Law of
Nature</i>, in the second. If the world were perfect, and the balance
of the human faculties undisturbed, it is evident that both
systems would give identical results. As it is, there is a tendency
to error on each side, which is fully developed in the
rival schools of the Epicureans and Stoics, who practically
divided the suffrages of the mass of educated men until the
coming of Christ.</p>

<p class="mid"><b>EPICUREANS.</b></p>

<p>Epicurus was born B.C. 342, and died B.C. 270. He
purchased a Garden within the city, and commenced, at
thirty-six years of age, to teach philosophy. The Platonists
had their academic Grove: the Aristotelians walked in the
Lyceum: the Stoics occupied the Porch: the Epicureans had
their Garden, where they lived a tranquil life, and seem to
have had a community of goods.</p>

<p>There is not one of all the various founders of the ancient
philosophical schools whose memory was cherished with so
much veneration by his disciples as that of Epicurus. For
several centuries after his death, his portrait was treated by
them with all the honors of a sacred relic: it was carried
about with them in their journeys, it was hung up in their
schools, it was preserved with reverence in their private chambers;
his birthday was celebrated with sacrifices and other religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="426">426</a></span>
observances, and a special festival in his honor was held
every month.</p>

<p>So much honor having been paid to the memory of Epicurus,
we naturally expect that his works would have been preserved
with religious care. He was one of the most prolific of
the ancient Greek writers. Diogenes calls him "a most voluminous
writer," and estimates the number of works composed
by him at no less than three hundred, the principal of which
he enumerates.<a id="footnotetag764" name="footnotetag764"></a>
<a href="#footnote764"><sup class="sml">764</sup></a> But out of all this prodigious collection, not
a single book has reached us in a complete, or at least an independent
form. Three letters, which contain some outlines
of his philosophy, are preserved by Diogenes, who has also embodied
his "Fundamental Maxims"--forty-four propositions,
containing a summary of his ethical system. These, with part
of his work "On Nature," found during the last century among
the Greek MSS. recovered at Herculaneum, constitute all that
has survived the general wreck.</p>

<p>We are thus left to depend mainly on his disciples and successors
for any general account of his system. And of the
earliest and most immediate of these the writings have perished.<a id="footnotetag765" name="footnotetag765"></a>
<a href="#footnote765"><sup class="sml">765</sup></a>
Our sole original authority is Diogenes Laertius, who
was unquestionably an Epicurean. The sketch of Epicurus
which is given in his "Lives" is evidently a "labor of love."
Among all the systems of ancient philosophy described by him,
there is none of whose general character he has given so skillful
and so elaborate an analysis. And even as regards the
particulars of the system, nothing could be more complete than
Laertius's account of his physical speculations. Additional
light is also furnished by the philosophic poem of Lucretius
"On the Nature of Things," which was written to advocate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="427">427</a></span>
physical theory of Epicurus. These are the chief sources of
our information.</p>

October, 1862.</blockquote>

<p>It is said of Epicurus that he loved to hearken to the stories
of the indifference and apathy of Pyrrhon, and that, in these
qualities, he aspired to imitate him. But Epicurus was not,
like Pyrrhon, a skeptic; on the contrary, he was the most imperious
dogmatist. No man ever showed so little respect for
the opinions of his predecessors, or so much confidence in his
own. He was fond of boasting that he had made his own philosophy--<i>he</i>
was a "self-taught" man! Now "Epicurus might
be perfectly honest in saying he had read very little, and had
worked out the conclusions in his own mind, but he was a
copyist, nevertheless; few men more entirely so."<a id="footnotetag766" name="footnotetag766"></a>
<a href="#footnote766"><sup class="sml">766</sup></a> His psychology
was certainly borrowed from the Ionian school. From
thence he had derived his fundamental maxim, that "sensation
is the source of all knowledge, and the standard of all truth."
His physics were copied from Democritus. With both, "atoms
are the first principle of all things." And in Ethics he had
learned from Aristotle, that if an absolute good is not the end
of a practical life, <i>happiness</i> must be its end.<a id="footnotetag767" name="footnotetag767"></a>
<a href="#footnote767"><sup class="sml">767</sup></a> All that is fundamental
in the system of Epicurus was borrowed from his predecessors,
and there is little that can be called new in his teaching.</p>

<p>The grand object of philosophy, according to Epicurus, <i>is
the attainment of a happy life</i>. "Philosophy," says he, "is the
power by which reason conducts men to happiness." Truth is
a merely relative thing, a variable quantity; and therefore the
pursuit of truth for its own sake is superfluous and useless.
There is no such thing as absolute, unchangeable right: no action
is intrinsically right or wrong. "We choose the virtues, not
on their own account, but for the sake of pleasure, just as we
seek the skill of the physician for the sake of health."<a id="footnotetag768" name="footnotetag768"></a>

<p>The proof which Epicurus offers in support of his doctrine,
"that pleasure is the chief good," is truly characteristic. "All
animals from the moment of their birth are delighted with
pleasure and offended with pain, by their natural instincts,
and without the employment of reason. Therefore we, also,
of our own inclination, flee from pain."<a id="footnotetag771" name="footnotetag771"></a>
<a href="#footnote771"><sup class="sml">771</sup></a> "All men like pleasure
and dislike pain; they naturally shun the latter and pursue the

Virtue thus consists in man's doing deliberately what the animals

<p>"Every kind of pleasure" is, in the estimation of Epicurus,
"alike good," and alike proper. "If those things which make
the pleasures of debauched men put an end to the fears of the
mind, and to those which arise about the heavenly bodies [supernatural
powers], and death and pain,... we should have
no pretense for blaming those who wholly devote themselves
to pleasure, and who never feel any pain, or grief (which is the
chief evil) from any quarter."<a id="footnotetag773" name="footnotetag773"></a>
<a href="#footnote773"><sup class="sml">773</sup></a> Whilst, however, all pleasures
of the body, as well as the mind, are equal in dignity, and alike
good, they differ in intensity, in duration, and, especially, in
their consequences. He therefore divides pleasure into two
classes; and in this, as Cousin remarks, is found the only element
of originality in his philosophy. These two kinds of
pleasure are:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="429">429</a></span>

<p>1. <i>The pleasure of movement, excitement, energy</i> (ἡδονὴ ἐν
κινήσει).<a id="footnotetag774" name="footnotetag774"></a>
<a href="#footnote774"><sup class="sml">774</sup></a> This is the most lively pleasure; it supposes the
greatest development of physical and mental power. "Joy
and cheerfulness are beheld in motion and energy." But it is
not the most enduring pleasure, and it is not the most perfect.
It is accompanied by uneasiness; it "brings with it many perturbations,"
and it yields some bitter fruits.</p>

<p>2. <i>The second kind of pleasure is the pleasure of repose, tranquillity,
impassibility</i> (ἡδονὴ καταστηµατική). This is a state, a
"condition," rather than a motion. It is "the freedom of the
body from pain, and the soul from confusion."<a id="footnotetag775" name="footnotetag775"></a>
<a href="#footnote775"><sup class="sml">775</sup></a> This is perfect
and unmixed happiness--the happiness of God; and he who
attains it "will be like a god among men." "The storm of
the soul is at an end, and body and soul are perfected."</p>

<p>Now, whilst "no pleasure is intrinsically bad,"<a id="footnotetag776" name="footnotetag776"></a>
<a href="#footnote776"><sup class="sml">776</sup></a> prudence
(φρόνησις), or practical wisdom, would teach us to choose the
highest and most perfect happiness. Morality is therefore the
application of reason to the conduct of life, and virtue is wisdom.
The office of reason is to "determine our choices"--to
take account of the duration of pleasures, to estimate their consequences,
and to regard the happiness of a whole lifetime,
and not the enjoyment of a single hour. Without wisdom men
will choose the momentary excitements of passion, and follow
after agitating pleasures, which are succeeded by pain; they
will consequently lose "tranquillity of mind." "It is not possible,"
says Epicurus, "to live pleasantly without living prudently
and honorably and justly."<a id="footnotetag777" name="footnotetag777"></a>
<a href="#footnote777"><sup class="sml">777</sup></a> The difference, then, between
the philosopher and the ordinary man is this--that while
both seek pleasure, the former knows how to forego certain
indulgences which cause pain and vexation hereafter, whereas
the ordinary man seeks only immediate enjoyment. Epicurus
does not dispense with virtue, but he simply employs it as a
means to an end, namely, the securing of happiness.<a id="footnotetag778" name="footnotetag778"></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="430" >430</a></span>

<p>Social morality is, like private morality, founded upon <i>utility.</i>
As nothing is intrinsically right or wrong in private life, so
nothing is intrinsically just or unjust in social life. "Justice
has no independent existence: it results from mutual contracts,
and establishes itself wherever there is a mutual engagement
to guard against doing or sustaining any injury. Injustice is
not intrinsically bad; it has this character only because there
is joined with it the fear of not escaping those who are appointed
to punish actions marked with this character."<a id="footnotetag779" name="footnotetag779"></a>
<a href="#footnote779"><sup class="sml">779</sup></a> Society is
thus a contract--an agreement to promote each other's happiness.
And inasmuch as the happiness of the individual depends
in a great degree upon the general happiness, the essence
of his ethical system, in its political aspects, is contained
in inculcating "the greatest happiness of the greatest number."</p>

<p>If you ask Epicurus what a man shall do when it is clearly
his immediate interest to violate the social contract, he would
answer, that if your general interest is secured by always observing
it, you must make momentary sacrifices for the sake of
future good. But "when, in consequence of new circumstances,
a thing which has been pronounced just does not any longer
appear to agree with utility, the thing which was just...
ceases to be just the moment it ceases to be useful."<a id="footnotetag780" name="footnotetag780"></a>
<a href="#footnote780"><sup class="sml">780</sup></a> So that
self-interest is still the basis of all virtue. And if, by the performance
of duty, you are exposed to great suffering, and especially
to death, you are perfectly justified in the violation of
any and all contracts. Such is the social morality of Epicurus.</p>

<p>With coarse and energetic minds the doctrine of Epicurus
would inevitably lead to the grossest sensuality and crime;
with men whose temperament was more apathetic, or whose
tastes were more pure, it would develop a refined selfishness--
a perfect egoism, which Epicurus has adorned with the name
"tranquillity of mind--impassibility," (ἀταραξία).<a id="footnotetag781" name="footnotetag781"></a>

(return) </a> It is scarcely necessary to discuss the question whether, by making
pleasure the standard of right, Epicurus intended to encourage what is
usually called sensuality. He earnestly protested against any such unfavorable
interpretation of his doctrine:--"When we say that pleasure is a chief
good, we are not speaking of the pleasures of the debauched man, or those
which lie in sensual enjoyment, as some think who are ignorant, and who do
not entertain our opinions, or else interpret them perversely; but we mean
the freedom of the body from pain, and the soul from confusion" ("Epicurus
to Menæceus," in Diogenes Laertius, "Lives," bk. x. ch. xxvii.). The most
obvious tendency of this doctrine is to extreme selfishness, rather than extreme
sensuality--a selfishness which prefers one's own comfort and case
to every other consideration.

<p>As to the personal character of Epicurus, opinions have been divided
both in ancient and modern times. By some the garden has been called a
"sty." Epicurus has been branded as a libertine, and the name "Epicurean"
has, in almost all languages, become the synonym of sensualism. Diogenes
Laertius repels all the imputations which are cast upon the moral character
of his favorite author, and ascribes them to the malignity and falsehood of
the Stoics. "The most modern criticism seems rather inclined to revert to
the vulgar opinion respecting him, rejecting, certainly with good reason, the
fanatical panegyrics of some French and English writers of the last century.
Upon the whole, we are inclined to believe that Epicurus was an apathetic,
decorous, formal man, who was able, without much difficulty, to cultivate a
measured and even habit of mind, who may have occasionally indulged in
sensual gratifications to prove that he thought them lawful, but who generally
preferred, as a matter of taste, the exercises of the intellect to the more
violent forms of self-indulgence. And this life, it seems to us, would be
most consistent with his opinions. To avoid commotion, to make the stream
of life flow on as easily as possible, was clearly the aim of his philosophy."--

<p>Physics and Psychology are thus the only studies which
Epicurus would tolerate as "conducive to the happiness of
man." The pursuit of truth for its own sake was useless.
Dialectics, which distinguish the true from the false, the good
from the bad, on <i>à priori</i> grounds, must be banished as an unnecessary
toil, which yields no enjoyment. Theology must be
cancelled entirely, because it fosters superstitious fears. The
idea of God's taking knowledge of, disapproving, condemning,
punishing the evil conduct of men, is an unpleasant thought.
Physics and Psychology are the most useful, because the most
"agreeable," the most "comfortable" sciences.</p>

<p>The two great principles of nature are a <i>vacuum</i>, and a <i>plenum.</i>
The plenum is <i>body</i>, or tangible nature; the vacuum is
<i>space</i>, or intangible nature. "We know by the evidences of
the senses (which are our only rule of reasoning) that <i>bodies</i>
have a real existence, and we infer from the evidence of the
senses that the vacuum has a real existence; for if space have
no real existence, there would be nothing in which bodies can
move, as we see they really do move. Let us add to this reflection
that one can not conceive, either in virtue of perception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="434">434</a></span>

quality peculiar to all beings, which is not either an attribute,

<a href="#footnote790"><sup class="sml">790</sup></a></p>

<p>Of bodies some are "combinations"--concrete bodies--and
some are primordial "elements," out of which combinations
are formed. These primordial elements, out of which the universe
is generated, are "<i>atoms</i>" (ἄτοµοι). These atoms are
"the first principles" and "seeds" of all things.<a id="footnotetag791" name="footnotetag791"></a>

introduced <i>arbitrarily</i>, or by some <i>external cause</i>. And inasmuch
as Epicurus admits of no causes "but space and matter,"
and rejects all divine or supernatural interposition, the <i>new</i>
movement must be purely arbitrary. They deviate <i>spontaneously,</i>
and of their own accord. "The system of nature immediately
appears <i>as a free agent</i>, released from tyrant masters, to
do every thing of itself spontaneously, without the help of the
gods."<a id="footnotetag799" name="footnotetag799"></a>
<a href="#footnote799"><sup class="sml">799</sup></a> The manner in which Lucretius proves this doctrine
is a good example of the petitio principii. He assumes, in
opposition to the whole spirit and tendency of the Epicurean
philosophy, that man has "a free will," and then argues that
if man who is nothing but an aggregation of atoms, can "turn
aside and alter his own movements," the primary elements, of
which his soul is composed, must have some original spontaneity.
"If all motion is connected and dependent, and a new
movement perpetually arises from a former one in a certain
order, and if the primary elements do not produce any commencement
of motion by deviating from the straight line to
break the laws of fate, so that cause may not follow cause in
infinite succession, <i>whence comes this freedom of will</i> to all animals
in the world? whence, I say, is this liberty of action
wrested from the fates, by means of which we go wheresoever
inclination leads each of us? whence is it that we ourselves
turn aside, and alter our motions, not at any fixed time, nor in
any fixed part of space, but just as our own minds prompt?....
Wherefore we must necessarily confess that the same is the
case with the seeds of matter, and there is some other cause
besides strokes and weight [resistance and density] from which
this power [of free movement] is innate in them, since we see
that <i>nothing is produced from nothing</i>."<a id="footnotetag800" name="footnotetag800"></a>
<a href="#footnote800"><sup class="sml">800</sup></a> Besides form, extension,
and density, Epicurus has found another inherent or essential
quality of matter or atoms, namely, "<i>spontaneous" motion.</i></p>

<p>A state of pure savagism, or rather of mere animalism, was
the primitive condition of man. He wandered naked in the
woods, feeding on acorns and wild fruits, and quenched his
thirst at the "echoing waterfalls," in company with the wild
beast.</p>

<p>Through the remaining part of book v. Lucretius describes
how speech was invented; how society originated, and governments
were instituted; how civilization commenced; and how
religion arose out of ignorance of natural causes; how the arts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="440">440</a></span>
of life were discovered, and how science sprang up. And all
this, as he is careful to tell us, without any divine instruction,
or any assistance from the gods.</p>

<p>Such are the physical theories of the Epicureans. The primordial
elements of matter are infinite, eternal, and self-moved.
After ages upon ages of chaotic strife, the universe at length
arose out of an <i>infinite</i> number of atoms, and a <i>finite</i> number
of forms, by a fortuitous combination. Plants, animals, and
man were spontaneously generated from ether and earth. Languages,
society, governments, arts were gradually developed.
And all was achieved simply by blind, unconscious nature-forces,
without any designing, presiding, and governing Intelligence--that
is, without a God.</p>

<p>The evil genius which presided over the method of Epicurus,
and perverted all his processes of thought, is clearly apparent.
The end of his philosophy was not the discovery of truth. He
does not commence his inquiry into the principles or causes
which are adequate to the explanation of the universe, with an
unprejudiced mind. He everywhere develops a malignant
hostility to religion, and the avowed object of his physical theories
is to rid the human mind of all fear of supernatural powers--that
is, of all fear of God.<a id="footnotetag806" name="footnotetag806"></a>

them to refer all things to the power of the divinities, and to
resign the dominion of the world to them; because of those

<p>To "expel these fancies from the mind" as "inconsistent with
its tranquillity and opposed to human happiness," is the end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="441" >441</a></span>
and, as Lucretius believes, the glory of the Epicurean philosophy.
To accomplish this, God must be placed at an infinite
distance from the universe, and must be represented as indifferent
to every thing that transpires within it. We "must beware
of making the Deity interpose here, for that Being we
ought to suppose <i>exempt from all occupation</i>, and perfectly happy,"<a id="footnotetag808" name="footnotetag808"></a>
<a href="#footnote808"><sup class="sml">808</sup></a>--that

<p>Epicurus is, then, an unmistakable Atheist. He did not admit
a God in any rational sense. True, he <i>professed</i> to believe
in gods, but evidently in a very equivocal manner, and solely
to escape the popular condemnation. "They are not pure
spirits, for there is no spirit in the atomic theory; they are not
bodies, for where are the bodies that we may call gods? In
this embarrassment, Epicurus, compelled to acknowledge that
the human race believes in the existence of gods, addresses
himself to an old theory of Democritus--that is, he appeals to
dreams. As in dreams there are images that act upon and
determine in us agreeable or painful sensations, without proceeding
from exterior bodies, so the gods are images similar to
those of dreams, but greater, having the human form; images
which are not precisely bodies, and yet not deprived of materiality
which are whatever you please, but which, in short, must
be admitted, since the human race believes in gods, and since
the universality of the religious sentiment is a fact which demands
a cause."<a id="footnotetag810" name="footnotetag810"></a>

<p class="mid"><b>EPICUREAN PSYCHOLOGY.</b>

<p>In the system of Epicurus, the soul is regarded as corporeal
or material, like the body; they form, together, one nature or
substance. The soul is composed of atoms exceedingly diminutive,
smooth, and round, and connected with or diffused
through the veins, viscera, and nerves. The substance of the
soul is not to be regarded as simple and uncompounded; its
constituent parts are <i>aura</i>, heat, and air. These are not sufficient,
however, even in the judgment of Epicurus, to account
for <i>sensation</i>; they are not adequate to generate sensible motives
such as revolve any thoughts in the mind. "A certain
fourth nature, or substance, must, therefore, necessarily be added
to these, <i>that is wholly without a name</i>; it is a substance,
however, than which nothing exists more active or more subtile,
nor is any thing more essentially composed of small and
smooth elementary particles; and it is this substance which
first distributes sensible motions through the members."<a id="footnotetag812" name="footnotetag812"></a>

<p>Epicurus is at great pains to prove that the soul is material;
and it can not be denied that he marshals his arguments with
great skill. Modern materialism may have added additional
illustrations, but it has contributed no new lines of proof. The
weapons are borrowed from the old arsenal, and they are not
wielded with any greater skill than they were by Epicurus
himself, I. The soul and the body act and react upon each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="443" >443</a></span>
other; and mutual reaction can only take place between substances
of similar nature. "Such effects can only be produced
by <i>touch</i>, and touch can not take place without <i>body</i>."<a id="footnotetag813" name="footnotetag813"></a>
<a href="#footnote813"><sup class="sml">813</sup></a> 2. The
mind is produced together with the body, it grows up along
with it, and waxes old at the same time with it.<a id="footnotetag814" name="footnotetag814"></a>
<a href="#footnote814"><sup class="sml">814</sup></a> 3. The mind
is diseased along with the body, "it loses its faculties by material
causes, as intoxication, or by severe blows; and is sometimes,
by a heavy lethargy, borne down into a deep eternal
sleep."<a id="footnotetag815" name="footnotetag815"></a>
<a href="#footnote815"><sup class="sml">815</sup></a> 4. The mind, like the body, is healed by medicines,
which proves that it exists only as a mortal substance.<a id="footnotetag816" name="footnotetag816"></a>
<a href="#footnote816"><sup class="sml">816</sup></a> 5.
The mind does not always, and at the same time, continue <i>entire</i>
and <i>unimpaired</i>, some faculties decay before the others,
"the substance of the soul is therefore divided." On all these
grounds the soul must be deemed mortal; it is dissolved along
with the body, and has no conscious existence after death.</p>

<p>Such being the nature of the soul, inasmuch as it is material,
all its knowledge must be derived from sensation. The
famous doctrine of perception, as taught by Epicurus, is grounded
upon this pre-supposition that the soul is corporeal. "The
ειδωλα ἀπόῤῥοιαι--<i>imagines, simulacra rerum, etc</i>., are, like pellicles,
continually flying off from objects; and these material
'likenesses,' diffusing themselves everywhere in the air, are
propelled to the perceptive organs." These images of things
coming in contact with the senses produce <i>sensation</i> (αἴσθησις).
A sensation may be considered either as regards its object, or
as regards him who experiences it. As regards him who experiences
it, it is simply a passive affection, an agreeable or disagreeable
feeling, passion, or sentiment (τὸ πάθος). But along
with sensation there is inseparably associated some knowledge
of the object which excites sensation; and it is for this reason
that Epicurus marked the intimate relation of these two phenomena
by giving them analogous names. Because the second
phenomenon is joined to the first, he calls it ἐπαίσθησις--
<span class="pagenum"><a name="444">444</a></span>
<i>perception</i>. It is sensation viewed especially in regard to its
object--<i>representative sensation</i>, or the "sensible idea" of modern
philosophy. It is from perception that we draw our general
ideas by a kind of prolepsis (πρόληψις) an anticipation or
laying hold by reason of that which is implied in sensation.
Now all sensations are alike true in so far as they are sensations,
and error arises from false reasoning about the testimony
of sense. All knowledge is purely relative and contingent,
and there is no such thing as necessary and absolute truth.</p>

<p>The system of Epicurus is thus a system of pure materialism,
but not a system of materialism drawn, as a logical consequence,
from a careful and unprejudiced study of the whole
phenomena of mind. His openly avowed design is to deliver
men from the fear of death, and rid them of all apprehension
of a future retribution. "Did men but know that there was a
fixed limit to their woes, they would be able, in some measure,
to defy the religious fictions and menaces of the poets; but
now, since we must fear eternal punishment at death, there is
no mode, no means of resisting them."<a id="footnotetag817" name="footnotetag817"></a>
<a href="#footnote817"><sup class="sml">817</sup></a>] To emancipate men
from "these terrors of the mind," they must be taught "that
the soul is mortal, and dissolves with the body"--that "death
is nothing to us, for that which is dissolved is devoid of sensation,
and that which is devoid of sensation is nothing to us."<a id="footnotetag818" name="footnotetag818"></a>
<a href="#footnote818"><sup class="sml">818</sup></a>
Starting with the fixed determination to prove that</p>

<p class="mid">"Death is nothing, and naught after death,"</p>

<p>he will not permit any mental phenomena to suggest to him
the idea of an incorporeal spiritual substance. Matter, under
any form known to Epicurus, is confessedly insufficient to explain
sensation and thought; a "nameless something" must

For aught that he knows it may as properly be called
"<i>spirit</i>" as matter. May not <i>sensation</i> and <i>cognition</i> be the result
of the union of matter and spirit; and if so, may not their
mutual affections, their common sympathies, be the necessary
conditions of sensation and cognition in the present life? A
reciprocal relation between body and mind appears in all mental
phenomena. A certain proportion in this relation is called
mental health. A deviation from it is termed disease. This
proportion is by no means an equilibrium, but the perfect
adaptation of the body, without injury to its integrity, to the
purposes of the mind. And if this be so, all the arguments of
materialism fall to the ground.</p>

discourses on <i>death</i>, is a mournful picture of the condition
of the heathen mind before Christianity "brought life and immortality
fully to light." It comes to us, like a voice from the

hope." To be delivered from the fear of future retribution,
they would sacrifice the hope of an immortal life. To extintinguish
guilt they would annihilate the soul. The only way

by reminding him that he will <i>escape the ills of life</i>.</p>

<p>It is evident that such a system of philosophy outrages the
purest and noblest sentiments of humanity, and, in fact, condemns
itself. It was born of selfishness and social degeneracy,
and could perpetuate itself only in an age of corruption, because
it inculcated the lawfulness of sensuality and the impunity of
injustice. Its existence at this precise period in Grecian history
forcibly illustrates the truth, that Atheism is a disease of
the heart rather than the head. It seeks to set man free to
follow his own inclinations, by ridding him of all faith in a
Divinity and in an immortal life, and thus exonerating him
from all accountability and all future retribution. But it failed
to perceive that, in the most effectual manner, it annihilated
all real liberty, all true nobleness, and made of man an abject
slave.</p>

<p class="mid"><b>STOICISM.</b></p>

<p>The Stoical school was founded by Zeno of Citium, who
flourished B.C. 290. He taught in the Stoa Poecile, or Painted
Porch; and his disciples thence derived the name of Stoics.
Zeno was succeeded by Cleanthes (B.C. 260); and Cleanthes
by Chrysippus (B.C. 240), whose vigorous intellect gave unity
and completeness to the Stoical philosophy. He is reported
to have said to Cleanthes,--"Give me your doctrines, and I
will find the demonstrations."<a id="footnotetag821" name="footnotetag821"></a>

<p>The philosophy of the Stoics, like that of the Epicureans,
was mainly a philosophy of life--that is, a <i>moral</i> philosophy.
The manner in which they approached the study of morals, and
the principles upon which they grounded morality, were, however,
essentially different.</p>

<p>The grand object of Epicurus was to make the current of
life flow on as comfortably as possible, without any distracting
thoughts of the past or any disturbing visions of the future.
He therefore starts with this fundamental principle, that the
true philosophy of life is to enjoy one's self--the aim of existence
is to be happy. Whatever in a man's beliefs or conduct
tends to secure happiness is <i>right</i>; whatever awakens uneasiness,
apprehension, or fear, is <i>wrong</i>. And inasmuch as the
idea of a Divine Creator and Governor of the universe, and
the belief in a future life and retribution, are uncomfortable
thoughts, exciting superstitious fears, they ought to be rejected.
The Physics and the Psychology of Epicurus are thus the natural
outgrowth of his Morality.</p>

<p>Zeno was evidently a more earnest, serious, and thoughtful
man. He cherished a nobler ideal of life than to suppose
"man must do voluntarily, what the brute does instinctively--
eschew pain, and seek pleasure." He therefore seeks to ascertain
whether there be not some "principle of nature," or some
law of nature, which determines what is right in human action
--whether there be not some light under which, on contemplating
an action, we may at once pronounce upon its intrinsic
<i>rightness</i>, or otherwise. This he believes he has found in the
<i>universal reason</i> which fashioned, and permeates, and vivifies
the universe, and is the light and life of the human soul. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="448">448</a></span>
chief good is, confessedly, to live according to nature; which is
to live according to virtue, for nature leads us to that point....
For our individual natures are all part of the universal nature;
on which account, the chief good is to live in a manner
corresponding to one's own nature, and to universal nature;
doing none of those things which the common law of mankind
(the universal conscience of our race) forbids. <i>That common
law is identical with</i> RIGHT REASON <i>which pervades every thing,
being the same with Jupiter</i> (Ζεύς), <i>who is the regulator and chief
manager of all existing things</i>.<a id="footnotetag824" name="footnotetag824"></a>
<a href="#footnote824"><sup class="sml">824</sup></a> The foundation of the ethical
system of the Stoics is thus laid in their philosophy of nature
--their Physiology and Psychology. If, therefore, we would
apprehend the logical connection and unity of Stoicism, we
must follow their order of thought--that is, we must commence
with their</p>

<p class="mid"><b>PHYSIOLOGY.</b></p>

<p>Diogenes Laertius tells us that the Stoics held "that there
are two general principles in the universe--the <i>passive</i> principle
(τὸ πάσχον), which is matter, an existence without any distinctive
quality, and the <i>active</i> principle (τὸ ποιοῦν), which is
the reason existing in the passive, that is to say, God. For
that He, being eternal, and existing throughout all matter,
makes every thing."<a id="footnotetag825" name="footnotetag825"></a>
<a href="#footnote825"><sup class="sml">825</sup></a> This Divine Reason, acting upon matter,
originates the necessary and unchangeable laws which govern
matter--laws which the Stoics called λόγοι σπερµατικοί--
generating reasons or causes of things. The laws of the world
are, like eternal reason, necessary and immutable; hence the
εἱµαρµένη--the <i>Destiny</i> of the Stoics, which is also one of the
names of the Deity.<a id="footnotetag826" name="footnotetag826"></a>
<a href="#footnote826"><sup class="sml">826</sup></a> But by Destiny the Stoics could not

<p>These two principles are not, however, regarded by the Stoics
as having a distinct, separate, and independent existence.
One is substance (οὐσία); the other is quality (ποῖος). The
primordial matter is the passive ground of all existence--the
original substratum for the Divine activity. The Divine Reason
is the active or formative energy which dwells within, and
is essentially united to, the primary substance. The Stoics,
therefore, regarded all existence as reducible, in its last analysis,
to <i>one substance</i>, which on the side of its passivity and capacity
of change, they called <i>hyle</i> (ὕλη);<a id="footnotetag828" name="footnotetag828"></a>
<a href="#footnote828"><sup class="sml">828</sup></a> and on the side of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="450">450</a></span>
changeless energy and immutable order, they called God. The
corporeal world--physical nature--is "a peculiar manifestation"
of God, generated from his own substance, and, after certain
periods, absorbed in himself. Thus God, considered in
the evolution of His power, is nature. And nature, as attached
to its immanent principle, is called God.<a id="footnotetag829" name="footnotetag829"></a>
<a href="#footnote829"><sup class="sml">829</sup></a> The fundamental

(return) </a> Or "matter." A good deal of misapprehension has arisen from confounding
the intellectual ὕλη of Aristotle and the Stoics with the gross physical
"matter" of the modern physicist. By "matter" we now understand
that which is corporeal, tangible, sensible; whereas by ὕλη, Aristotle and
the Stoics (who borrowed the term from him) understood that which is incorporeal,
intangible, and inapprehensible to sense,--an "unknown something"
which must necessarily be <i>supposed</i> as the condition of the existence
of things. The <i>formal</i> cause of Aristotle is "the substance and essence"--
the primary nature of things, on which all their properties depend. The <i>material</i>
cause is "the matter or subject" through which the primary nature
manifests itself. Unfortunately the term "material" misleads the modern
thinker. He is in danger of supposing the <i>hyle</i> of Aristotle to be something
sensible and physical, whereas it is an intellectual principle whose inherence
is implied in any physical thing. It is something distinct from <i>body</i>, and has
none of those properties we are now accustomed to ascribe to matter. Body,
corporeity, is the result of the union of "hyle" and "form." Stobaeus thus
expounds the doctrine of Aristotle: Form alone, separate from matter (ὕλη)
is <i>incorporeal</i>; so matter alone, separated from form, is not <i>body</i>. But there
is need of the joint concurrence of both these--matter and form--to make
the substance of body. Every individual substance is thus a totality of
matter and form--a σίνολον.

<p>The Stoics taught that God is <i>oneliness</i> (Diogenes Laertius, "Lives of the
Philosophers," bk. vii. ch. lxviii.); that he is <i>eternal</i> and <i>immortal</i> (bk. vii.
ch. lxxii.); he could not, therefore, be corporeal, for "body <i>infinite, divisible,</i>
and <i>perishable</i>" (bk. vii. ch. lxxvii.). "All the parts of the world are perishable,
for they change one into another; therefore the world is perishable"
(bk. vii. ch. lxx.). The Deity is not, therefore, absolutely identified
with the world by the Stoics. He permeates all things, creates and dissolves
all things, and is, therefore, <i>more</i> than all things. The world is finite;
God is infinite.</p></blockquote>

<p>Schwegler affirms that, in physics, the Stoics, for the most
part, followed Heraclitus, and especially "carried out the proposition

This is not a just representation of the views of the

Also, that elements have bodies, and have forms, <i>but principles

<p>On a careful collation of the fragmentary remains of the
early Stoics, we fancy we catch glimpses of the theory held by
some modern pantheists, that the material elements, "having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="451">451</a></span>
body and form," are a vital transformation of the Divine substance;
and that the forces of nature--"the generating causes
or reasons of things" (λόγοι σπερµατικοί)--are a conscious transmutation
of the Divine energy. This theory is more than
hinted in the following passages, which we slightly transpose
from the order in which they stand in Diogenes Laertius, without
altering their meaning. "They teach that the Deity was
in the beginning by <i>himself</i>".... that "first of all, he made
the four elements, fire, water, air, and earth." "The fire is the
highest, and that is called æther, in which, first of all, the
sphere was generated in which the fixed stars are set...;
after that the air; then the water; and the sediment, as it were,
of all, is the earth, which is placed in the centre of the rest."
"He turned into water the whole substance which pervaded
the air; and as the seed is contained in the product, so, too,
He, being the seminal principle of the world, remained still in
moisture, making matter fit to be employed by himself in the
production of things which were to come after."<a id="footnotetag834" name="footnotetag834"></a>
<a href="#footnote834"><sup class="sml">834</sup></a> The Deity
thus draws the universe out of himself, transmuting the divine
substance into body and form. "God is a being of a certain
quality, having for his peculiar manifestation universal substance.
He is a being imperishable, and who never had any
generation, being the maker of the arrangement and order that
we see; and who at certain periods of time <i>absorbs all substance
in himself and then reproduces it from himself</i>."<a id="footnotetag835" name="footnotetag835"></a>
<a href="#footnote835"><sup class="sml">835</sup></a> And
now, in the last analysis, it would seem as though every thing
is resolved into <i>force</i>. God and the world are <i>power, and its
manifestation</i>, and these are ultimately one. "This identification
of God and the world, according to which the Stoics
regarded the whole formation of the universe as but a period
in the development of God, renders their remaining doctrine
concerning the world very simple. Every thing in the world
seemed to be permeated by the Divine life, and was regarded
as the flowing out of this most perfect life through certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="452">452</a></span>
channels, until it returns, in a necessary circle, back to

<p class="mid"><b>PSYCHOLOGY.</b></p>

<p>As in the world there are two principles, the passive and
the active, so in the understanding there are two elements: a
passive element--<i>sensation</i>, and an active element--<i>reason</i>.</p>

<p>All knowledge commences with the phenomena of sensation
(αἴσθησις). This produces in the soul an image (φαντασία),
which corresponds to the exterior object, and which Chrysippus
regarded as a modification of the mind (ἀλλοίωσις).<a id="footnotetag840" name="footnotetag840"></a>

<p>Associate with sensibility is thought--the faculty of general ideas--the
ὀρθὸς λόγος, or right reason, as the supreme power and the
guiding light of humanity. This active principle is of divine
origin, "a part or shred of the Divinity."</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote840"
name="footnote840"><b>Footnote 840: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag840">
(return) </a> Diogenes Laertius, "Lives of the Philosophers," bk. vii. ch. xxxiv.</blockquote>

<p>This "right reason," or "common reason," is the source
and criterion of all truth; "for our individual natures are all
parts of the universal nature," and, therefore, all the dictates
of "common reason" are "identical with that right reason
which pervades every thing, being the same with Jupiter, who
is the regulator and chief manager of all things."</p>

<p>The fundamental canon of the logic of the Stoics, therefore,
was that "what appears to all, that is to be believed, for it is
apprehended by the reason, which is common and Divine."</p>

<p>It is needless to remark that the Stoics were compelled by
their physiological theory to deny the proper immortality of the
soul. Some of them seem to have supposed that it might, for
a season, survive the death of the body, but its ultimate destination
was absorption into the Divine essence. It must return
to its original source.</p>

<p class="mid"><b>ETHICS.</b></p>

<p>If reason be the great organizing and controlling law of the
universe, then, to live conformable to reason is the great practical
law of life. Accordingly, the fundamental ethical maxim
of the Stoics is, "Live conformably with nature--that is, with
reason, or the will of the universal governor and manager of all
things."<a id="footnotetag841" name="footnotetag841"></a>
<a href="#footnote841"><sup class="sml">841</sup></a> Thus the chief good (εὐδαιµονία) is the conformity
of man's actions to reason--that is, to the will of God, "for
nothing is well done without a reference to God."<a id="footnotetag842" name="footnotetag842"></a>

<p>It is obvious that this doctrine must lead to a social morality
and a jurisprudence the very opposite of the Epicurean.
If we must do that which is good--that is, that which is reasonable,
regardless of all consequences, then it is not for the
pleasurable or useful results which flow from it that justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="455" >455</a></span>
should be practised, but because of its intrinsic excellence.
Justice is constituted good, not by the law of man, but by the
law of God. The highest pleasure is to do right; "this very
thing is the virtue of the happy man, and the perfect happiness
of life, when every thing is done according to a harmony of the
genius of each individual to the will of the Universal Governor
and Manager of all things."<a id="footnotetag843" name="footnotetag843"></a>
<a href="#footnote843"><sup class="sml">843</sup></a> Every thing which interferes
with a purely rational existence is to be eschewed; the pleasures
and pains of the body are to be despised. To triumph
over emotion, over suffering, over passion; to give the fullest
ascendency to reason; to attain courage, moral energy, magnanimity,
constancy, was to realize true manhood, nay, "to be
godlike; for they have something in them which is, as it were,
a god"<a id="footnotetag844" name="footnotetag844"></a>
<a href="#footnote844"><sup class="sml">844</sup></a></p>

<p>The sublime heroism of the Stoic school is well expressed
in the manly precept, "Ἀνεχοῦ"--<i>sustine</i>--endure. "Endure
the sorrows engendered by the bitter struggle between the passions
support all the evils which fortune shall send thee--calumny,
betrayal, poverty, exile, irons, death itself." In Epictetus
and Marcus Aurelius this spirit seems to rise almost to
the grandeur of Christian resignation. "Dare to lift up thine
eyes to God and say, 'Use me hereafter to whatsoever thou
pleasest. I agree, and am of the same mind with thee, indifferent
to all things. Lead me whither thou pleasest. Let me
act what part thou wilt, either of a public or a private person,

<p>Amid the fearful moral degeneracy of imperial Rome, Stoicism
became the refuge of all noble spirits. But, in spite of its
severity, and its apparent triumph over the feelings, it brought
no real freedom and peace. "Stoical morality, strictly speaking,
is, at bottom, only a slavish morality, excellent in Epictetus;
admirable still, but useless to the world, in Marcus Aurelius."
Pride takes the place of real disinterestedness. It
stands alone in haughty grandeur and solitary isolation, tainted
with an incurable egoism. Disheartened by its metaphysical
impotence, which robs God of all personality, and man of all
hope of immortality; defeated in its struggle to obtain purity
of soul, it sinks into despair, and often terminates, as in the
case of its two first leaders, Zeno and Cleanthes, and the two
Romans, Cato and Seneca, in self-murder. "Thus philosophy

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h3>THE PROPÆDEUTIC OFFICE OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY.</h3>

<p>"Philosophy, before the coming of the Lord, was necessary to the
Greeks for righteousness, and it now proved useful for godliness, being in
some part a preliminary discipline (προπαιδεία τις οὖσα) for those who reap
the fruits of faith through demonstration. Perhaps we may say it was given
to the Greeks with this special object; for philosophy was to the Greeks
what the Law was to the Jews, 'a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ.'"
--CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS.</p>

<p>Philosophy, says Cousin, is the effort of <i>reflection</i>--the
attempt of the human mind to develop in systematic and
logical form that which has dimly revealed itself in the spontaneous
thought of ages, and to account to itself in some manner
for its native and instinctive beliefs. We may further add, it
is the effort of the human mind to attain to truth and certitude
on purely rational grounds, uncontrolled by traditional authorities.
The sublime era of Greek philosophy was, in fact,
an independent effort of human reason to solve the great problems
of existence, of knowledge, and of duty. It was an attempt
to explain the phenomenal history of the universe, to interpret
the fundamental ideas and laws of human reason, to
comprehend the utterances of conscience, and to ascertain
what Ultimate and Supreme Reality underlies the world of
phenomena, of thought, and of moral feeling.<a id="footnotetag848" name="footnotetag848"></a>
<a href="#footnote848"><sup class="sml">848</sup></a> And it is this
which, for us, constitutes its especial value; that it was, as far
as possible, a result of simple reason; or, if at any time Faith
asserted its authority, the distinction is clearly marked: If
this inquiry was fully, and honestly, and logically conducted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="458" >458</a></span>
we are entitled to presume that the results attain by this
effort of speculative thought must harmonize with the positive
utterances of the Divine Logos--the Eternal Reason, whose
revelations are embalmed and transmitted to us in the Word
of God. If the great truth that man is "the <i>offspring of God"</i>
and as such "<i>the image and glory of God</i>" which is asserted,
alike, by Paul and the poet-philosophers of Tarsus and Mysia,
be admitted, then we may expect that the reason of man shall
have some correlation with the Divine reason. The mind of
man is the <i>chef-d'œuvre</i> of Divine art. It is fashioned after the
model which the Divine nature supplies. "Let us make man
in <i>our</i> image after <i>our</i> likeness." That image consists in
ἐπίγνωσις--<i>knowledge;</i> δικαιοσύνη--<i>justice</i>; and ὁσιότης--<i>benevolence.</i>
It is not merely the <i>capacity</i> to know, to be just, and to
be beneficent; it is <i>actual</i> knowledge, justice, and benevolence.
It supposes, first, that the fundamental ideas of the true, the
just, and the good, are connate to the human mind; second,
that the native determination of the mind is towards the realization
of these ideas in every mental state and every form of
human activity; third, that there is a constitutional sympathy
of reason with the ideas of truth, and righteousness, and goodness,
as they dwell in the reason of God. And though man be
now fallen, there is still within his heart some vestige of his
primal nature. There is still a sense of the divine, a religious
aptitude, "a feeling after God," and some longing to return to
Him. There are still ideas in the reason, which, in their natural
and logical development compel him to recognize a God.
There is within his conscience a sense of duty, of obligation,
and accountability to a Superior Power--"a law of the mind,"
thought opposed and antagonized by depraved passions and
appetites--"the law in the members." There is yet a natural,
constitutional sympathy of reason with the law of God--"it
delights in that law," and consents "that it is good," but it is
overborne and obstructed by passion. Man, even as unregenerate,
"wills to do that which is good," but "how to perform
that which is good he finds not," and in the agony of his soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="459" >459</a></span>
he exclaims, "Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver
me!"<a id="footnotetag849" name="footnotetag849"></a>

<p>The Author of nature is also the Author of revelation. The
Eternal Father of the Eternal Son, who is the grand medium
of all God's direct communications to our race--the revealer
of God, is also "the Father of the spirits of all flesh." That
divine inbreathing which first constituted man "a living soul"
--that "inspiration of the Almighty which giveth man understanding,"
and still "teacheth him knowledge," proceeds from
the same Spirit as that which inspires the prophets and seers
of the Old Testament Church, and the Apostles and teachers
of the new. That "true light which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world" shone on the mind of Anaxagoras, and
Socrates, and Plato, as well as on the mind of Abraham and
Rahab, Cornelius and the Syro-Phoenician woman, and, in a
higher form, and with a clearer and richer effulgence, on the
mind of Moses, Isaiah, Paul and John. It is not to be wondered
at, then, if, in the teaching of Socrates and Plato, we
should find a striking <i>harmony</i> of sentiment, and even form of
expression, with some parts of the Christian revelation. No
short-sighted jealousy ought to impugn the honesty of our judgment,
if, in the speculations of Plato, we catch glimpses of a
world of ideas not unlike that which Christianity discloses, and
hear words not unfamiliar to those who spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>If, then, there exists some correlation between Divine and
human reason, and if the light which illuminates all minds in
Christian and in heathen lands is the <i>same</i> "true light," though
differing in degrees of brightness, it is most natural and reasonable
to expect some connection and some correspondence
between the discoveries of philosophy and the revelations of
the Sacred Oracles.</p>

<p>Although Christianity is confessedly something which is
above reason and nature--something communicated from
above, and therefore in the fullest sense supernatural and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="460" >460</a></span>
superhuman, yet it must stand in <i>relation</i> to reason and nature,
and to their historic development; otherwise it could not operate
on man at all. "We have no knowledge of a dynamic
influence, spiritual or natural, without a dynamic reaction."
Matter can only be moved by forces, and according to laws,
as it has properties which correlate it with these forces and
laws. And mind can not be determined from without to any
specific form of cognition, unless it have powers of apprehension
and conception which are governed by uniform laws. If
man is to be instructed by a verbal revelation, he must, at least,
be capacitated for the reception of divine communication--must
have a power of forming supersensuous conceptions, and
there must be some original community of thought and idea
between the mind that teaches and the mind that is taught.
A revelation from an invisible God--a being "whom no man
has ever seen or ever can see" with the eye of sense--would
have no affinity for, and no power to affect and enlighten, a
being who had no presentiment of an invisible Power to which
he is in some way related. A revealed law promulgated from
an unseen and utterly unknown Power would have no constraining
authority, if man had no idea of right, no sense of
duty, no feeling of obligation to a Supreme Being. If, therefore,
religious instruction be not already preceded by an innate
consciousness of God, and of obligation to God, as an operative
predisposition, there would be nothing for revelation to act
upon. Some relation between the reason which planned the
universe, and which has expressed its thoughts in the numerical
relations and archetypal forms which are displayed therein,
and the reason of man, with its ideas of form and number, proportion
and harmony, is necessarily supposed in the statement
of Paul that "the invisible things of God from the creation are
seen." Nature to us could be no symbol of the Divine
Thought, if there were no correlation between the reason of
man and the reason of God. All revelation, indeed, supposes
some community of nature, some affinities of thought, some
correlation of ideas, between the mind communicating spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="461">461</a></span>
knowledge, and the mind to which the communication is made.
In approaching man, it must traverse ground already occupied
by man; it must employ phrases already employed, and assume
forms of thought already familiar to man. It must address
itself to some ideas, sentiments, and feelings already
possessed by man. If religion is the great end and destination
of man, then the nature of man must be constituted for
religion. Now religion, in its inmost nature, is a communion,
a fellowship with God. But no creature can be brought into
this communion "save one that is constitutionally related to
God in terms that admit of correspondence." There must be
intelligence offered to his intelligence, sentiment to his sentiment,
reason to his reason, thought to his thought. There must
be implanted in the human mind some fundamental ideas and
determinations grounded upon this fact, that the real end and
destination of man is for religion, so that when that higher
sphere of life and action is presented to man, by an outward
verbal revelation, there shall be a recognized harmony between
the inner idea and determination, and the outer revelation.
We can not doubt that such a relation between human nature
and reason, and Christianity, exists. We see evidences of this
in the perpetual strivings of humanity to attain to some fuller
and clearer apprehension of that Supreme Power which is consciously
near to human thought, and in the historic development
of humanity towards those higher forms of thought and
existence which demand a revelation in order to their completion.
This original capacity, and this historical development,
have unquestionably prepared the way for the reception of
Christianity.</p>

<p>Christianity, then, must have some connection with the reason
of man, and it must also have some relation to the progressive
developments of human thought in the ages which
preceded the advent of Christ. Christianity did not break
suddenly upon the world as a new commencement altogether
unconnected with the past, and wanting in all points of sympathy
and contact with the then present. It proceeded along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="462">462</a></span>
lines of thought which had been laid through ages of preparation;
it clothed itself in forms of speech which had been
moulded by centuries of education, and it appropriated to itself
a moral and intellectual culture which had been effected
by long periods of severest discipline. It was, in fact, the
consummation of the whole moral and religious history of the
world.</p>

<p>A revelation of new truths, presented in entirely new forms
of thought and speech, would have defeated its own ends, and,
practically, would have been no revelation at all. The divine
light, in passing through such a medium, would have been
darkened and obscured. The lens through which the heavenly
rays are to be transmitted must first be prepared and polished.
The intellectual eye itself must be gradually accustomed to
the light. Hence it is that all revelation has been <i>progressive</i>,
commencing, in the infancy of our race, with images and symbols
addressed to sense, and advancing, with the education of
the race, to abstract conceptions and spiritual ideas. The first
communications to the patriarchs were always accompanied by
some external, sensible appearance; they were often made
through some preternatural personage in human form. Subsequently,
as human thought becomes assimilated to the Divine
idea, God uses man as his organ, and communicates divine
knowledge as an internal and spiritual gift. The theistic conception
of the earliest times was therefore more or less anthropomorphic,
in the prophetic age it was unquestionably more
spiritual. The education of Hebraic, Mosaic, and prophetic
ages had gradually developed a purer theism, and prepared
the Jewish mind for that sublime announcement of our Lord's--"God
is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship
in spirit." For ages the Jews had worshipped in Samaria
and Jerusalem, and the inevitable tendency of thought was to
localize the divine presence; but the gradual withdrawment
from these localities of all visible tokens of Jehovah's presence,
prepared the way for the Saviour's explicit declaration
that "neither in this mountain of Samaria, nor yet at Jerusalem,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="463" >463</a></span>
shall men worship the Father," to the exclusion of any other
spot on earth; the real temple of the living God is now the
heart of man. The <i>Holiness</i> of God was an idea too lofty for
human thought to grasp at once. The light of God's ineffable
purity was too bright and dazzling to burst at once on human
eyes. Therefore it was gradually displayed. The election of
a chosen seed in Abraham's race to a nearer approach to God
than the rest of pagan humanity; the announcement of the
Decalogue at Sinai amidst awe-inspiring wonders; the separation
of a single tribe to the priestly office, who were dedicated
to, and purified in an especial manner for the service of the
tabernacle; the sanctification of the High-priest by sacrifice
and lustration before he dared to enter "the holiest place"--the
presence-chamber of Jehovah: and then the direct and explicit
teaching of the prophets--were all advancing steps by
which the Jewish mind was lifted up to the clearer apprehension
of the holiness of God, the impurity of man, the distance
of man from God, and the need of Mediation.</p>

<p>The ideas of <i>Redemption</i> and <i>Salvation</i>--of atonement, expiation,
pardon, adoption, and regeneration--are unique and
<i>sui-generis</i>. Before these conceptions could be presented in
the fullness and maturity of the Christian system, there was
needed the culture and education of the ages of Mosaic ritualism,
with its sacrificial system, its rights of purification, its
priestly absolution, and its family of God.<a id="footnotetag850" name="footnotetag850"></a>
<a href="#footnote850"><sup class="sml">850</sup></a> Redemption itself,
as an economy, is a development, and has consequently, a history--a
history which had its commencement in the first Eden,
and which shall have its consummation in the second Eden of
a regenerated world. It was germinally infolded in the first
promise, gradually unfolded in successive types and prophecies,
more fully developed in the life, and sayings, and sufferings of
the Son of God, and its ripened fruit is presented to the eye of
faith in the closing scenic representations of the grand Apocalypse
of John. "Judaism was not given as a perfect religion.
Whatever may have been its superiority over surrounding forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="464" >464</a></span>
of worship, it was, notwithstanding, a provisional form only.
The consciousness that it was a preparatory, and not a definite
dispensation, is evident throughout. It points to an end beyond
itself, suggests a grander thought than any in itself; its
glory precisely consists in its constant looking forward to a glorious
future destined to surpass it."<a id="footnotetag851" name="footnotetag851"></a>

<p>Thus the determinations which, through Redemption, fall to

<a href="#footnote852"><sup class="sml">852</sup></a> Christianity was preceded by
ages of preparation, in which we have a gradual development
of religious phrases and ideas, of forms of social life and intellectual
culture, and of national and political institutions most
favorable to its advent and its promulgation; and "in the fullness
of time"--the maturity and fitness of the age--"God sent

<p>This work of preparation was not confined alone to Judaism.
The divine plan of redemption comprehended all the race; its
provisions are made in view of the wants of all the race; and
we must therefore believe that the entire history of the race,
previous to the coming of the Redeemer, was under a divine
supervision, and directed towards the grand centre of our
world's history. Greek philosophy and Grecian civilization
must therefore have a place in the divine plan of history, and
they must stand in an important relation to Christianity. He
who "determined the time of each nation's existence, and fixed
the geographical boundaries of their habitation in order that
they may seek the Lord," can not have been unmindful of the
Greek nation, and of its grandest age of philosophy. "The
Father of the spirits of all flesh" could not be unconcerned in
the moral and spiritual welfare of any of his children. He was
as deeply interested in the Athenian as in the Hebrew. He is
the God of the Gentile as well as the Jew. His tender mercies
are over all his works. If the Hebrew race was selected to be
the agent of his providence in one special field, and if the Jewish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="465" >465</a></span>
theocracy was one grand instrument of preparatory discipline,
it was simply because, through these, God designed to
bless all the nations of the earth. And surely no one will presume
to say that a civilization and an intellectual culture which
was second only to the Hebrew, and, in some of its aspects,
even in advance of the Hebrew, was not determined and supervised
by Divine Providence, and made subservient to the
education and development of the whole race. The grand results
of Hebrew civilization were appropriated and assimilated
by Christianity, and remain to this day. And no one can deny
that the same is true of Greek civilization. Through a kind
of historic preparation the heathen world was made ready for
Christ, as a soil is prepared to receive the seed, and some precious
fruits of knowledge, of truth, and of righteousness, even,
were largely matured, which have been reaped, and appropriated,
and vitalized by the heaven-descended life of Christianity.</p>

<p>The chief points of excellence in the civilization of the
Greeks are strikingly obvious, and may be readily presented.
High perfection of the intellect and the imagination displaying
itself in the various forms of art, poetry, literature, and philosophy.
A wonderful freedom and activity of body and of mind,
developed in trade, and colonization, in military achievement,
and in subtile dialectics. A striking love of the beautiful, revealing
itself in their sculpture and architecture, in the free
music of prosaic numbers, and the graceful movement and
measure of their poetry. A quickness of perception, a dignity
of demeanor, a refinement of taste, a delicacy of moral sense,
and a high degree of reverence for the divine in nature and humanity.
And, in general, a ripe and all-pervading culture,
which has made Athens a synonym for all that is greatest and
best in the genius of man; so that literature, in its most flourishing
periods has rekindled its torch at her altars, and art has
looked back to the age of Pericles for her purest models.<a id="footnotetag853" name="footnotetag853"></a>

these enter into the very idea of Greek civilization. We can
not resist the conviction that, by a Divine Providence, it was
made subservient to the purpose of Redemption; it prepared
the way for, and contributed to, the spread of the Gospel.</p>

(return) </a> In Lord Brougham's celebrated letter to the father of the historian
Macaulay in regard to the education of the latter, we read: "If he would be
a great orator, he must go at once to the fountain-head, and be familiar with
every one of the great orations of Demosthenes.... I know from experience
that nothing is half so successful in these times (bad though they be)
as what has been formed on the Greek models. I use poor illustrations in
giving my own experience, but I do assure you that both in courts and Parliament,
and even to mobs, I have never made so much play (to use a very
modern phrase) as when I was almost translating from the Greek. I composed
the peroration of my speech for the Queen, in the Lords, after reading
and repeating Demosthenes for three or four weeks."</blockquote>

<p>Its subserviency to this grand purpose is seen in the Greek
tendency to trade and colonization. Their mental activity was
accompanied by great physical freedom of movement. They
displayed an inherent disposition to extensive emigration.
"Without aiming at universal conquest, they developed (if we
may use the word) a remarkable catholicity of character, and a
singular power of adaptation to those whom they called Barbarians.
In this respect they were strongly contrasted with the
Egyptians, whose immemorial civilization was confined to the
long valley which extended from the cataracts to the mouth of
the Nile. The Hellenic tribes, on the other hand, though they
despised the foreigners, were never unwilling to visit them
and to cultivate their acquaintance. At the earliest period at
which history enables us to discover them, we see them moving
about in their ships on the shores and among the islands
of their native seas; and, three or four centuries before the
Christian era, Asia Minor, beyond which the Persians had not
been permitted to advance, was bordered by a fringe of Greek
colonies; and lower Italy, when the Roman Republic was just
becoming conscious of its strength, had received the name of
Greece itself. To all these places they carried their arts and
literature, their philosophy, their mythology, and their amusements....
They were gradually taking the place of the Phœnicians
in the empire of the Mediterranean. They were, indeed,
less exclusively mercantile than those old discoverers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="467" >467</a></span>
Their voyages were not so long. But their influence on general
civilization was greater and more permanent. The earliest
ideas of scientific navigation and geography are due to
the Greeks. The later Greek travellers, Pausanias and Strabo,
are our best sources of information on the topography of St.
Paul's journeys.</p>

<p>"With this view of the Hellenic character before us, we are
prepared to appreciate the vast results of Alexander's conquests.
He took the meshes of the net of Greek civilization
which were lying in disorder on the edge of the Asiatic shore,
and spread them over all the countries he traversed in his
wonderful campaigns. The East and the West were suddenly
brought together. Separate tribes were united under a common
government. New cities were built as the centres of
political life. New lines of communication were opened as
the channels of commercial activity. The new culture penetrated
the mountain ranges of Pisidia and Lycaonia. The
Tigris and Euphrates became Greek rivers. The language of
Athens was heard among the Jewish colonies of Babylonia,
and a Grecian Babylon was built by the conqueror in Egypt,
and called by his name.</p>

<p>"The empire of Alexander was divided, but the effects of
his campaigns and policy did not cease. The influence of
these fresh elements of social life was rather increased by being
brought into independent action within the sphere of distinct
kingdoms. Our attention is particularly directed to two of the
monarchical lines which descended from Alexander's generals--the
Ptolemies, or the Greek kings of Egypt, and the Seleucidæ,
or the Greek kings of Syria. Their respective capitals,
Alexandria and Antioch, became the metropolitan centres of
commercial and civilized life in the East."<a id="footnotetag854" name="footnotetag854"></a>
<a href="#footnote854"><sup class="sml">854</sup></a> Antioch was for
ages the home of science and philosophy. Here the religious
opinions of the East and the West were blended and mutually
modified. Here it was discovered by the heathen mind that
a new religion had appeared, and a new revelation had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="468" >468</a></span>
given.<a id="footnotetag855" name="footnotetag855"></a>
<a href="#footnote855"><sup class="sml">855</sup></a> In Alexandria all nations were invited to exchange
their commodities and, with equal freedom, their opinions.
The representatives of all religions met here. "Beside the
Temple of Jupiter there rose the white marble Temple of Serapis,
and close at hand stood the synagogue of the Jews." The
Alexandrian library contained all the treasures of ancient culture,
and even a copy of the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>

<p>The spread of the Greek <i>language</i> was one of the most important
services which the cities of Antioch and Alexandria
rendered to Christianity. The Greek tongue is intimately connected
with the whole system of Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>This language, which, in symmetry of structure, in flexibility
and compass of expression, in exactness and precision, in grace
and elegance, exceeds every other language, became the language
of theology. Next in importance to the inspiration
which communicates the superhuman thought, must be the
gradual development of the language in which the thought can
clothe itself. That development by which the Greek language
became the adequate vehicle of Divine thought, the perfect
medium of the mature revelation of truth contained in the
Christian Scriptures, must be regarded as the subject of a
Divine providence. Christianity waited for that development,
and it awaited Christianity. "The Greek tongue became to
the Christian more than it had been to the Roman or the Jew.
The mother-tongue of Ignatius at Antioch was that in which
Philo composed his treatises at Alexandria, and which Cicero
spoke at Athens. It is difficult to state in a few words the important
relation which Alexandria, more especially, was destined
to bear to the whole Christian Church." In that city,
the Old Testament was translated into Greek; there the writings
of Plato were diligently studied; there Philo, the Platonizing
Jew, had sought to blend into one system the teachings
of the Old Testament theology and the dialectic speculations
of Plato. Numenius learns of Philo, and Plotinus of Numenius,
and the ecstasy of Plotinus is the development of Philo's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="469">469</a></span>
intuitions. A <i>theological language</i> by this means was developed,
rich in the phrases of various schools, and suited to convey the
spiritual revelation of Christian ideas to all the world. "It
was not an accident that the New Testament was written in
Greek, the language which can best express the highest thoughts
and worthiest feelings of the intellect and heart, and which is
adapted to be the instrument of education for all nations; nor
was it an accident that the composition of these books and the
promulgation of the Gospels were delayed till the instruction
of our Lord, and the writings of his Apostles could be expressed
in the dialect [of Athens and] of Alexandria."<a id="footnotetag856" name="footnotetag856"></a>
<a href="#footnote856"><sup class="sml">856</sup></a>] This
must be ascribed to the foreordination of Him who, in the history
of nations and of civilizations, "worketh all things according
to the counsel of his own will."</p>

<p>Now it is the doctrine of the best philologists that language
is a <i>growth</i>. Gradually, and by combined efforts of successive
generations, it has been brought to the perfection which we so
much admire in the idioms of the Bible, the poetry of Homer,
Dante, and Shakspeare, and the prose compositions of Demosthenes,
Cicero, Johnson, and Macaulay. The material or root-element
of language may have been the product of mental instinct,
or perhaps the immediate gift of God by revelation;
but the formal element must have been the creation of thought,
and the result of rational combination. Language is really
the incarnation of thought; consequently the growth of a language,
its affluence, comprehension, and fullness must depend
on the vigor and activity of thought, and the acquisition
of general ideas. Language is thus the best index of intellectual
progress, the best standard of the intellectual attainment
of an age or nation. The language of barbaric tribes is exceedingly
simple and meagre; the paucity of general terms
clearly indicating the absence of all attempts at classification
and all speculative thought. Whilst the language of educated
peoples is characterized by great fullness and affluence of
terms, especially such as are expressive of general notions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="470" >470</a></span>
abstract ideas. All grammar, all philology, all scientific nomenclature
are thus, in fact, <i>psychological deposits</i>, which register
the progressive advancement of human thought and knowledge
in the world of mind, as the geological strata bear testimony to
the progressive development of the material world. "Language,"
says Trench, "is fossil poetry, fossil history," and, we
will add, fossil philosophy. Many a single word is a concentrated
poem. The record of great social and national revolutions
is embalmed in a single term.<a id="footnotetag857" name="footnotetag857"></a>
<a href="#footnote857"><sup class="sml">857</sup></a> And the history of an
age of philosophic thought is sometimes condensed and deposited
in one imperishable word.<a id="footnotetag858" name="footnotetag858"></a>

<p>If, then, language is the creation of thought, the sensible
vesture with which it clothes itself, and becomes, as it were, incarnate--if
the perfection and efficiency of language depends
on the maturity and clearness of thought, we conclude that the
wonderful adequacy and fitness of the Greek language to be
the vehicle of the Divine thought, the medium of the most perfect
revelation of God to men, can only be explained on the
assumption that the ages of philosophic thought which, in
Greece, preceded the advent of Christianity, were under the
immediate supervision of a providence, and, in some degree,
illuminated by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Greek philosophy must therefore have fulfilled a propædeutic
office for Christianity. "As it had been intrusted to the
Hebrews to preserve and transmit the heaven-derived element
of the Monotheistic religion, so it was ordained that, among the
Greeks, all seeds of human culture should unfold themselves
in beautiful harmony, and then Christianity, taking up the opposition
between the divine and human, was to unite both in
one, and show how it was necessary that both should co-operate
to prepare for the appearance of itself and the unfolding of
what it contains."<a id="footnotetag859" name="footnotetag859"></a>
<a href="#footnote859"><sup class="sml">859</sup></a> During the period of Greek philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="471" >471</a></span>
which preceded the coming of Christ, human reason, unfolding
itself from beneath, had aspired after that knowledge of divine
things which is from above. It had felt within itself the
deep-seated consciousness of God--the sporadic revelation of
Him "who is not far from any one of us"--the immanent
thought of that Being "in whom we live and move and are,"
and it had striven by analysis and definition to attain a more
distinct and logical apprehension. The heart of man had been
stirred with "the feeling after God"--the longing for a clearer
sense of the divine, and had struggled to attain, by abstraction
or by ecstasy, a more immediate communion with God. Man
had been conscious of an imperative obligation to conform to
the will of the great Supreme, and he sought to interpret more
clearly the utterances of conscience as to what duty was. He
had felt the sense of sin and guilt, and had endeavored to appease
his conscience by expiatory offerings, and to deliver himself
from the power of sin by intellectual culture and moral
discipline. And surely no one, at all familiar with the history
of that interesting epoch in the development of humanity, will
have the hardihood to assert that no steps were taken in the
right direction, and no progress made towards the distant goal
of human desire and hope. The language, the philosophy, the
ideals of moral beauty and excellence, the noble lives and nobler
utterances of the men who stand forth in history as the
representatives of Greek civilization, all attest that their noble
aspiration and effort did not end in ignominious failure and
utter defeat. It is true they fell greatly beneath the realization
of even their own moral ideals, and they became painfully conscious
of their moral weakness, as men do even in Christian
times. They learned that, neither by intellectual abstraction,
nor by ecstasy of feeling, could they lift themselves to a living,
conscious fellowship with God. The sense of guilt was unrelieved
by expiations, penances, and prayers. And whilst some
cultivated a proud indifference, a Stoical apathy, and others
sank down to Epicurean ease and pleasure, there was a noble
few who longed and hoped with increasing ardor for a living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="472" >472</a></span>
Redeemer, a personal Mediator, who should "stand between
God and man and lay his hand on both." Christ became in
some dim consciousness "the Desire of Nations," and the
Moral Law became even to the Greek as well as the Jew "a
school-master to lead them to Him."</p>

<p>The arrival of Paul at Athens, in the close of this brilliant
period of Greek philosophy, now assumes an aspect of deeper
interest and profounder significance. It was a grand climacteric
in the life of humanity--an epoch in the moral and religious
history of the world. It marked the consummation of
a periodic dispensation, and it opened a new era in that wonderful
progression through which an overruling Providence is
carrying the human race. As the coming of the Son of God
to Judea in the ripeness of events--"the fullness of time"--was
the consummation of the Jewish dispensation, and the
event for which the Jewish age had been a preparatory discipline,
so the coming of a Christian teacher to Athens, in the
person of "the Apostle of the Gentiles," was the <i>terminus ad
quem</i> towards which all the phases in the past history of philosophic
thought had looked, and for which they had prepared.
Christianity was brought to Athens--brought into contact with
Grecian philosophy at the moment of its exhaustion--at the
moment when, after ages of unwearied effort, it had become
conscious of its weakness, and its comparative failure, and had
abandoned many questions in despair. Greek philosophy had
therefore its place in the plan of Divine Providence. It had
a mission to the world; that mission was now fulfilled. If it
had laid any foundation in the Athenian mind on which the
Christian system could plant its higher truths--if it had raised
up into the clearer light of consciousness any of those <i>ideas</i>
imbedded in the human reason which are germane to Christian
truth--if it had revealed more fully the wants and instincts of
the human heart, or if it had attained the least knowledge of
eternal truth and immutable right, upon this Christianity placed
its <i>imprimatur</i>. And at those points where human reason had
been made conscious of its own inefficiency, and compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="473" >473</a></span>
own its weakness and its failure, Christianity shed an effulgent
and convincing light.</p>

<p>Therefore the preparatory office of Greek religion and Greek
philosophy is fully recognized by Paul in his address to the
Athenians. He begins by saying that the observations he had
made enabled him to bear witness that the Athenians were indeed,
in every respect, "a God-fearing people;"--that the God
whom they knew so imperfectly as to designate Him "the Unknown,"
but whom "they worshipped," was the God he worshipped,
and would now more fully declare to them. He assures
them that their past history, and their present geographical
position, had been the object of Divine foreknowledge and
determination. "He hath determined beforehand the times of
each nation's existence, and fixed the geographical boundaries
of their habitation," all with this specific design, that they might
"seek after," "feel after," and "find the Lord," who had never
been far from any one of them. He admits that their poet-philosophers
had risen to a lofty apprehension of "the Fatherhood
of God," for they had taught that "we are all his offspring;" and
he seems to have felt that in asserting the common brotherhood
of our race, he would strike a chord of sympathy in the loftiest
school of Gentile philosophy. He thus "recognized the Spirit
of God brooding over the face of heathenism, and fructifying
the spiritual element in the heart even of the natural man. He
feels that in these human principles there were some faint adumbrations
of the divine, and he looked for their firmer delineation
to the figure of that gracious Master, higher and holier
than man, whom he contemplated in his own imagination, and
whom he was about to present to them."<a id="footnotetag860" name="footnotetag860"></a>

<p>This function of ancient philosophy is distinctly recognized
by many of the greatest of the Fathers, as Justin, Clement,
Origen, Augustine, and Theodoret. Justin Martyr believed
that a ray of the Divine Logos shone on the mind of the heathen,
and that the human soul instinctively turned towards God
as the plant turns towards the sun. "Every race of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="474" >474</a></span>
participated in the Word. And they who lived with the Word
were Christians, even if they were held to be godless; as, for
example, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and those
like them."<a id="footnotetag861" name="footnotetag861"></a>
<a href="#footnote861"><sup class="sml">861</sup></a> Clement taught that "philosophy, before the coming
of the Lord, was necessary to the Greeks for righteousness;
and now it proved useful for godliness, being a sort of preliminary
discipline for those who reap the fruits of faith through
demonstration.... Perhaps we may say that it was given to
the Greeks with this special object, for it brought the Greek
nation to Christ as the Law brought the Hebrews."<a id="footnotetag862" name="footnotetag862"></a>
<a href="#footnote862"><sup class="sml">862</sup></a> "Philosophy

<a href="#footnote863"><sup class="sml">863</sup></a> Referring to the words
of Paul, Origen says, the truths which philosophers taught were

that have been nobly said."<a id="footnotetag864" name="footnotetag864"></a>
<a href="#footnote864"><sup class="sml">864</sup></a> And Augustine, whilst deprecating
the extravagant claims made for the great Gentile teachers,
allows "that some of them made great discoveries, so far

<a href="#footnote865"><sup class="sml">865</sup></a> They had, as he elsewhere

the teaching of nature, what prophets learnt from the spirit."<a id="footnotetag866" name="footnotetag866"></a>
<a href="#footnote866"><sup class="sml">866</sup></a>
In addressing the Greeks, Theodoret says, "Obey your own
philosophers; let them be your initiators; for they announced
beforehand our doctrines." He held that "in the depths of human
nature there are characters inscribed by the hand of God."
And that "if the race of Abraham received the divine law, and

<p>In attempting to account for this partial harmony between
Philosophy and Revelation, we find the Patristic writers adopting
different theories. They are generally agreed in maintaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="475">475</a></span>
some original connection, but they differ as to its immediate
source. Some of them maintained that the ancient philosophers
derived their purest light from the fountain of Divine
Revelation. The doctrines of the Old Testament Scriptures
were traditionally diffused throughout the West before the rise
of philosophic speculation. If the theistic conceptions of
Plato are superior to those of Homer it is accounted for by his
(hypothetical) tour of inquiry among the Hebrew nation, as
well as his Egyptian investigations. Others maintained that
the similarity of views on the character of the Supreme Being
and the ultimate destination of humanity which is found in the
writings of Plato and the teachings of the Bible is the consequence
of <i>immediate</i> inspiration. Origen, Jerome, Eusebius,
Clement, do not hesitate to affirm that Christ himself revealed
his own high prerogatives to the gifted Grecian. From this
hypothesis, however, the facts of the case compel them to make
some abatements. In the mid-current of this divine revelation
are found many acknowledged errors, which it is impossible to
ascribe to the celestial illuminator. Plato, then, was <i>partially</i>
inspired, and clouded the heavenly beam with the remaining
grossnesses of the natural sense.<a id="footnotetag868" name="footnotetag868"></a>
<a href="#footnote868"><sup class="sml">868</sup></a> Whilst a third, and more
reasonable, hypothesis was maintained by others. They regarded
man as "the offspring and image of the Deity," and
maintained there must be a correlation of the human and divine
reason, and, consequently, of all discovered truth to God.
Therefore they expected to find some traces of connection and
correspondence between Divine and human thought, and some
kindred ideas in Philosophy and Revelation. "Ideas," says
St. Augustine, "are the primordial forms, as it were, the immutable
reason of things; they are not created, they are eternal,
and always the same: they are contained in the Divine intelligence
and without being subject to birth and death, they are
<i>types</i> according to which is formed every thing that is born and
dies." The copies of these archetypes are seen in nature, and
are participated in by the reason of man; and there may therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="476" >476</a></span>
be some community of idea between man and God, and
some relation between Philosophy and Christianity.</p>

<p>The various attempts which have been made to trace the
elevated theism and morality of Socrates and Plato to Jewish
sources have signally failed. Justin Martyr and Tertullian
claim that the ancient philosophers "borrowed from the Jewish
prophets." Pythagoras and Plato are supposed to have travelled

<a href="#footnote869"><sup class="sml">869</sup></a> The latter is imagined

<a href="#footnote870"><sup class="sml">870</sup></a>
They are obviously mere suppositions by which over-zealous

all wisdom flowed from the East.<a id="footnotetag871" name="footnotetag871"></a>
<a href="#footnote871"><sup class="sml">871</sup></a> That Plato visited Egypt
at all, rests on the single authority of Strabo, who lived at least
four centuries after Plato; there is no trace in his own works
of Egyptian research. His pretended travels in Phœnicia,
where he gained from the Jews a knowledge of the true God,
are more unreliable still. Plato lived in the fourth century
before Christ (born B.C. 430), and there is no good evidence
of the existence of a Greek version of the Old Testament before
that of "the Seventy" (Septuagint), made by order of
Ptolemy Philadelphus, B.C. 270. Jeremiah, the prophet of
Israel, lived two centuries before Plato; consequently any
personal intercourse between the two was simply impossible.

<p>Some of the ablest Christian scholars and divines of modern
times, as Cudworth, Neander, Trench, Pressensé, Merivale,
Schaff, after the most careful and conscientious investigation,
have come to this conclusion, that Greek philosophy fulfilled
a preparatory mission for Christianity. The general conclusions
they reached are forcibly presented in the words of Pressensé:</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overstate the importance of Greek
philosophy when viewed as a preparation to Christianity. Disinterested
pursuit of truth is always a great and noble task.
The imperishable want of the human mind to go back to first
principles, suffices to prove that this principle is divine. We
may abuse speculation; we may turn it into one of the most
powerful dissolvents of moral truths; and the defenders of
positive creeds, alarmed by the attitude too often assumed by
speculation in the presence of religion, have condemned it as
mischievous in itself, confounding in their unjust prejudice its
use and its abuse. But, for all serious thinkers, philosophy is
one of the highest titles of nobility that humanity possesses:
and when we consider its mission previous to Christianity, we
feel convinced that it had its place in the Divine plan. It was
not religion in itself that philosophy, through its noblest representatives,
combated, but polytheism. It dethroned the false
gods. Adopting what was best in paganism, philosophy employed
it as an instrument to destroy paganism, and thus clear
the way for definite religion. Above all, it effectually contributed
to purify the idea of Divinity, though this purification was
but an approximation. If at times it caught glimpses of the
highest spiritualism, yet it was unable to protect itself against
the return and reaction of Oriental dualism. In spite of this
imperfection, which in its way served the cause of Christianity
by demonstrating the necessity of revelation, men like Socrates
and Plato fulfilled amongst their people a really sublime mission.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="478">478</a></span>

<p>They were to the heathen world the great prophets of
the human conscience, which woke up at their call. And the
awakening of the moral sense was at once the glory and ruin
of philosophy; for conscience, once aroused, could only be
satisfied by One greater than they, and must necessarily reject
all systems which proved themselves insufficient to realize the
moral idea they had evoked.</p>

<p>"But to perish thus, and for such a cause, is a high honor
to a philosophy. It was this made the philosophy of Greece,
like the Hebrew laws, though in an inferior sense, a schoolmaster
that led to Jesus Christ, according to the expression of
Clement of Alexandria. Viewed in this light, it was a true
gift of God, and had, too, the shadow of good things to come,
awakening the presentiment and desire of them, though it
could not communicate them. Nor can we conceive a better
way to prepare for the advent of Him who was to be 'the Desire
of Nations' before becoming their Saviour."<a id="footnotetag873" name="footnotetag873"></a>

<p>In previous chapters we have endeavored to sketch the
history of the development of metaphysical thought, of moral
feeling and idea, and of religious sentiment and want, which
characterized Grecian civilization. In now offering a brief
<i>résumé</i> of the history of that development, with the design of
more fully exhibiting the preparatory office it fulfilled for
Christianity, we shall assume that the mind of the reader has
already been furnished and disciplined by preparatory principles.
He can scarce have failed to recognize that this development
obeyed a <i>general law</i>, however modified by exterior
and geographical conditions; the same law, in fact, which
governs the development of all individual finite minds, and
which law may be formulated thus:--<i>All finite mind develops
itself, first, in instinctive determinations and spontaneous faiths;
then in rising doubt, and earnest questioning, and ill-directed inquiry;
and, finally, in systematic philosophic thought, and rational
belief</i>. These different stages succeed each other in the individual
mind. There is, first, the simplicity and trust of childhood;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="479" >479</a></span>
secondly, the undirected and unsettled force of youth;
and, thirdly, the wisdom of mature age. And these different
stages have also succeeded each other in the universal mind of
humanity. There has been, 1st. <i>The era of spontaneous beliefs</i>--of
popular and semi-conscious theism, morality, and religion,
2d. <i>The transitional age</i>--the age of doubt, of inquiry, and of
ill-directed mental effort, ending in fruitless sophism, or in
skepticism. 3d. <i>The philosophic or conscious age</i>--the age of
reflective consciousness, in which, by the analysis of thought,
the first principles of knowledge are attained, the necessary
laws of thought are discovered, and man arrives at positive
convictions, and rational beliefs. In the history of Grecian
civilization, the first is the Homeric age; the second is the
pre-Socratic age, ending with the Sophists; and the third is
the grand Socratic period. History is thus the development
of the fundamental elements of humanity, according to an established
law, and under conditions which are ordained and
supervised by the providence of God. "The unity of civilization
is in the unity of human nature; its varieties, in the variety
of the elements of humanity," which elements have been
successively developed in the course of history. All that is
fundamental in human nature passes into the movement of
civilization. "I say all that is fundamental; for it is the excellency
of history to take out, and throw away all that is not
necessary and essential. That which is individual shines for
a day, and is extinguished forever, or stops at biography."
Nothing endures, except that which is fundamental and true--that
which is vital, and organizes itself, develops itself, and
arrives at an historical existence. "Therefore as human nature
is the matter and basis of history, history is, so to speak, the
judge of human nature, and historical analysis is the counter-proof
of psychological analysis."<a id="footnotetag874" name="footnotetag874"></a>

<p>Nature, individual mind, and collective humanity, all obey
the law of progressive development; otherwise there could be
no history, for history is only of that which has movement and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="480" >480</a></span>
progress. Now, all progress is from the indefinite to the definite,
from the inorganic to the organic and vital, from the instinctive
to the rational, from a dim, nebulous self-feeling to a
high reflective consciousness, from sensuous images to abstract
conceptions and spiritual ideas. This progressive development
of nature and humanity has not been a series of creations
<i>de novo</i>, without any relation, in matter or form, to that
which preceded. All of the present was contained in embryonic
infoldment in the past, and the past has contributed its
results to the present.<a id="footnotetag875" name="footnotetag875"></a>
<a href="#footnote875"><sup class="sml">875</sup></a> The present, both in nature, and history,
and civilization, is, so to speak, the aggregate and sum-total
of the past. As the natural history of the earth may now
be read in the successive strata and deposits which form its
crust, so the history of humanity may be read in the successive
deposits of thought and language, of philosophy and art, which
register its gradual progression. As the paleontological remains
imbedded in the rocks present a succession of organic
types which gradually improve in form and function, from the
first sea-weed to the palm-tree, and from the protozoa to the
highest vertebrate, so the history of ancient philosophy presents
a gradual progress in metaphysical, ethical, and theistic conceptions,
from the unreflective consciousness of the Homeric
age, to the high reflective consciousness of the Platonic period.
And as all the successive forms of life in pre-Adamic ages
were a preparation for and a prophecy of the coming of man,
so the advancing forms of philosophic thought, during the
grand ages of Grecian civilization, were a preparation and a
prophecy of the coming of the Son of God.</p>

<p>We shall now endeavor to trace this process of gradual
preparation for Christianity in the Greek mind--</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="481" >481</a></span></p>

<p>  (i.) <i>In the field of</i> THEISTIC <i>conceptions</i>.</p>

<p> (ii.) <i>In the department of</i> ETHICAL <i>ideas and principles</i>.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>In the region of</i> RELIGIOUS <i>sentiment</i>.</p>

<p>In the field of theistic conception the propædeutic office of
Grecian philosophy is seen--</p>

<p>I. <i>In the release of the popular mind from Polytheistic notion,
and the purifying and spiritualizing of the Theistic idea</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of a Supreme Power, a living Personality, energizing
in nature, and presiding over the affairs of men, is not the
product of philosophy. It is the immanent, spontaneous
thought of humanity. It has, therefore, existed in all ages,
and revealed itself in all minds, even when it has not been
presented to the understanding as a definite conception, and
expressed by human language in a logical form. It is the
thought which instinctively arises in the opening reason of
childhood, as the dim and shadowy consciousness of a living
mind behind all the movement and change of the universe.
Then comes the period of doubt, of anxious questioning, and
independent inquiry. The youth seeks to account to himself
for this peculiar sentiment. He turns his earnest gaze towards
nature, and through this living vesture of the infinite he seeks
to catch some glimpses of the living Soul. In some fact appreciable
to sense, in some phenomenon he can see, or hear, or
touch, he would fain grasp the cause and reason of all that is.
But in this field of inquiry and by this method he finds only a
"receding God," who falls back as he approaches, and is ever
still beyond; and he sinks down in exhaustion and feebleness,
the victim of doubt, perhaps despair. Still the sentiment of
the Divine remains, a living force, in the centre of his moral
being. He turns his scrutinizing gaze within, and by self-reflection
seeks for some rational ground for his instinctive faith.
There he finds some convictions he can not doubt, some ideas
he can not call in question, some thoughts he is compelled to
think, some necessary and universal principles which in their
natural and logical development ally him to an unseen world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="482" >482</a></span>
and correlate and bind him fast to an invisible, but real God.
The more his mind is disciplined by abstract thought, the
clearer do these necessary and universal principles become, and
the purer and more spiritual his ideas of God. God is now for
him the First Principle of all principles, the First Truth of all
truths; the Eternal Reason, the Immutable Righteousness, the
Supreme Good. The normal and healthy development of
reason, the maturity of thought, conduct to the recognition of
the true God.</p>

<p>And so it has been in the universal consciousness of our
race as revealed in history. There was first a period of spontaneous
and unreflective Theism, in which man felt the consciousness
of God, but could not or did not attempt a rational
explanation of his instinctive faith. He saw God in clouds
and heard Him in the wind. His smile nourished the corn,
and cheered the vine. The lightnings were the flashes of his
vengeful ire, and the thunder was his angry voice. But the
unity of God was feebly grasped, the rays of the Divinity
seemed divided and scattered amidst the separate manifestations
of power, and wisdom, and goodness, and retribution,
which nature presented. Then plastic art, to aid and impress
the imagination, created its symbols of these separate powers
and principles, chiefly in human form, and gods were multiplied.
But all this polytheism still rested on a dim monotheistic
background, and all the gods were subordinated to Zeus--"the
Father of gods and men." Humanity had still the sense
of the dependence of all finite being on one great fountain-head
of Intelligence and Power, and all the "generated gods"
were the subjects and ministers of that One Supreme. This
was the childhood of humanity so vividly represented in Homeric
poetry.</p>

<p>Then came a period of incipient reflection, and speculative
thought, in which the attention of man is drawn outward to the
study of nature, of which he can yet only recognize himself as
an integral part. He searches for some ἀρχή--some first principle,
appreciable to sense, which in its evolution shall furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="483" >483</a></span>
an explanation of the problem of existence. He tries the
hypothesis of "<i>water</i>" then of "<i>air</i>" then of "<i>fire</i>" as the
primal element, which either is itself, or in some way infolds
within itself an informing Soul, and out of which, by vital
transformation, all things else are produced. But here he
failed to find an adequate explanation; his reason was not satisfied.
Then he sought his first principle in "<i>numbers</i>" as
symbols, and, in some sense, as the embodiment of the rational
conceptions of order, proportion, and harmony,--God is
the original <i>µονάς</i>--unity--One;--or else he sought it in purely
abstract "<i>ideas</i>" as unity, infinity, identity, and all things
are the evolution of an eternal thought, one and identical,
which is God. And here again he fails. Then he supposes
an unlimited <i>µῑγµα</i>--a chaotic mixture of elements existing
from eternity, which was separated, combined, and organized
by the energy of a Supreme Mind, the <i>νοῦς</i> of Anaxagoras.
But he holds not firmly to this great principle; "he recurs
again to air, and ether, and water, as <i>causes</i> for the ordering of
all things."<a id="footnotetag876" name="footnotetag876"></a>
<a href="#footnote876"><sup class="sml">876</sup></a> And after repeated attempts and failures, he is
disappointed in his inquiry, and falls a prey to doubt and skepticism.
This was the early youth of our humanity, the period
that opens with Thales and ends with the Sophists.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote876"
name="footnote876"><b>Footnote 876: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag876">
(return) </a> Thus Socrates complains of Anaxagoras. See "Phædo," § 108.</blockquote>

<p>The problem of existence still waits for and demands a solution.
The heart of man, also, still cries out for the living
God. The Socratic maxim, "know thyself," introverts the mental
gaze, and self-reflection now becomes the method of philosophy.
The Platonic analysis of thought reveals elements
of knowledge which are not derived from the outer world.
There are universal and necessary principles revealed in consciousness
which, in their natural and logical development, transcend
consciousness, and furnish the cognition of a world of
Real Being, beyond the world of sense. There are absolute
truths which bridge the chasm between the seen and the unseen,
the fleeting and the permanent, the finite and the infinite,
the temporal and the eternal. There are necessary laws of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="484">484</a></span>
thought which are also found to be laws of things, and which
correlate man to a living, personal, righteous Lord and Lawgiver.
From absolute ideas Plato ascends to an <i>absolute Being</i>,
the author of all finite existence. From absolute truths to
an <i>absolute Reason</i>, the foundation and essence of all truth.
From the principle of immutable right to an <i>absolutely righteous
Being</i>. From the necessary idea of the good to a being of <i>absolute
Goodness</i>--that is, to <i>God</i>. This is the maturity of humanity,
the ripening manhood of our race which was attained
in the Socratic age.</p>

<p>The inevitable tendency of this effort of speculative thought,
spread over ages, and of the intellectual culture which necessarily
resulted, was to undermine the old polytheistic religion,
and to purify and elevate the theistic conception. The school
of Elea rejected the gross anthropomorphism of the Homeric
theology. Xenophanes, the founder of the school, was a believer
in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"<i> One God</i>, of all beings divine and human the greatest,</p>
<p>   Neither in body alike unto mortals, neither in ideas."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And he repels with indignation the anthropomorphic representations
of the Deity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>When speaking of the mythology of the older Greeks, Socrates

<p>It was, however, the matured dialectic of Plato which gave
the death-blow to polytheism. "Plato, the poet-philosopher,
sacrificed Homer himself to monotheism. We may measure
the energy of his conviction by the greatness of the sacrifice.
He could not pardon the syren whose songs had fascinated
Greece, the fresh brilliant poetry that had inspired its religion.
He crowned it with flowers, but banished it, because it had
lowered the religious ideal of conscience." He was sensible
of the beauty of the Homeric fables, but he was also keenly
alive to their religious falsehood, and therefore he excluded the
poets from his ideal republic. In the education of youth, he
would forbid parents and teachers repeating "the stories which
Hesiod and Homer and the other poets told us." And after
instancing a number of these stories "which deserve the
gravest condemnation," he enjoins that God must be represented
as he is in reality. "God," says he, "is, beyond all else,
good in reality, and therefore so to be represented;" "he can
not do evil, or be the cause of evil;" "he is of simple essence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="486" >486</a></span>
and can not change, or be the subject of change;" "there is
no imperfection in the beauty or goodness of God;" "he is a
God of truth, and can not lie;" "he is a being of perfect simplicity
and truth in deed and word."<a id="footnotetag883" name="footnotetag883"></a>
<a href="#footnote883"><sup class="sml">883</sup></a> The reader can not fail
to recognize the close resemblance between the language of
Plato and the language of inspiration.</p>

<p>The theistic conception, in Plato, reaches the highest purity
and spirituality. God is "<i>the Supreme Mind</i>," "incorporeal,"
"unchangeable," "infinite," "absolutely perfect," "essentially
good," "unoriginated and eternal." He is "the Father and
Maker of the world," "the efficient Cause of all things," "the
Monarch and Ruler of the world," "the Sovereign Mind that
orders all things," and "pervades all things." He is "the
sole principle of all things," "the beginning of all truth," "the
fountain of all law and justice," "the source of all order and
beauty;" in short, He is "the beginning, middle, and end of
all things."<a id="footnotetag884" name="footnotetag884"></a>

<p>Aristotle continued the work of undermining polytheism.
He defines God as "the Eternal Reason"--the Supreme
Mind. "He is the immovable cause of all movement in the
universe, the all-perfect principle. This principle or essence
pervades all things. It eternally possesses perfect happiness,
and its happiness consists in energy. This primeval mover is
immaterial, for its essence is energy--it is pure thought, thought
thinking itself--the thought of thought."<a id="footnotetag885" name="footnotetag885"></a>
<a href="#footnote885"><sup class="sml">885</sup></a> Polytheism is thus
swept away from the higher regions of the intelligence. "For
several to command," says he, "is not good, there should be
but one chief. A tradition, handed down from the remotest
antiguity, and transmitted under the veil of fable, says that all
the stars are gods, and that the Divinity embraces the whole of
nature. And round this idea other mythical statements have
been agglomerated, with a view to influencing the vulgar, and
for political and moral expediency; as for instance, they feigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="487" >487</a></span>
that these gods have human shape, and are like certain of the
animals; and other stories of the kind are added on. Now, if
any one will separate from all this the first point alone, namely,
that they thought the first and deepest grounds of existence to
be Divine, he may consider it a divine utterance."<a id="footnotetag886" name="footnotetag886"></a>
<a href="#footnote886"><sup class="sml">886</sup></a> The popular
polytheism, then, was but a perverted fragment of a deeper
and purer "Theology." This passage is a sort of obituary of
polytheism. The ancient glory of paganism had passed away.
Philosophy had exploded the old theology. Man had learned
enough to make him renounce the ancient religion, but not
enough to found a new faith that could satisfy both the intellect
and the heart. "Wherefore we are not to be surprised that
the grand philosophic period should be followed by one of incredulity
and moral collapse, inaugurating the long and universal
<i>decadence</i> which was, perhaps, as necessary to the work of
preparation, as was the period of religious and philosophic development."</p>

form of the theistic proof which is now employed by

<p>The major premise of this syllogism is a fundamental principle
of reason--a self-evident truth, an axiom of common
sense, and as such has been recognized from the very dawn of
philosophy. Ἀδύνατον γίνεσθαί τι ἐκ µηδενὸς προὔπάρχοντος--<i>Ex
nihilo nihil</i>--<i>Nothing which once was not, could ever of itself come
into being</i>. Nothing can be made or produced without an efficient
cause, is the oldest maxim of philosophy. It is true that
this maxim was abusively employed by Democritus and Epicurus
to disprove a Divine creation of any thing out of nothing,
yet the great body of ancient philosophers, as Pythagoras,
Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Anaxagoras, Empedocles,
Plato, and Aristotle, regarded it as the announcement of an
universal conviction, that nothing can be produced without an
efficient cause;--order can not be generated out of chaos, life
out of dead matter, consciousness out of unconsciousness, reason
out of unreason. A first principle of life, of order, of reason,
must have existed anterior to all manifestions of order, of
life, of intelligence, in the visible universe. It was clearly in
this sense that Cicero understood this great maxim of the ancient
philosophers of Greece. With him "<i>De nihilo nihil fit"</i>
is equivalent to "<i>Nihil sine causa</i>"--nothing exists without a
cause. This is unquestionably the form in which that fundamental
law of thought is stated by Plato: "Whatever is generated
is necessarily generated from a certain cause, for it is
wholly impossible that any thing should be generated without
a cause."<a id="footnotetag887" name="footnotetag887"></a>
<a href="#footnote887"><sup class="sml">887</sup></a> And the efficient cause is defined as "a power
whereby that which did not previously exist was afterwards
made to be."<a id="footnotetag888" name="footnotetag888"></a>
<a href="#footnote888"><sup class="sml">888</sup></a> It is scarcely needful to remark that Aristotle,
the scholar of Plato, frequently lays it down as a postulate of
reason, "that we admit nothing without a cause."<a id="footnotetag889" name="footnotetag889"></a>
<a href="#footnote889"><sup class="sml">889</sup></a> By an irresistible

<p>The major premise of this syllogism is a fact of observation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="489">489</a></span>
To the eye of sense and sensible observation, to scientific induction
even in its highest generalizations, the visible universe
presents nothing but a history and aggregation of phenomena--a
succession of appearances or effects having more or less
resemblance. It is a ceaseless flow and change, "a generation
and corruption," "a becoming, but never really <i>is</i>;" it is never
in two successive moments the <i>same</i>.<a id="footnotetag890" name="footnotetag890"></a>

<p>Therefore the ancient philosophers concluded justly, there
must be something ἀγέννητον--something which was never
generated, something αὐτοϕυής and αὐθυπόστατον--self-originated
and self-existing, something ταὐτόν and αἰώνιον--immutable
and eternal, the object of rational apperception--which is
the real ground and efficient cause of all that appears.</p>

<p>(2.) The COSMOLOGICAL proof, or the argument based upon
the principle of order, and thus presented:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>    Order, proportion, harmony, are the product and expression
    of Mind.</p>

<p>    The created universe reveals order, proportion, and harmony.</p>

<p>    Therefore, the created universe is the product of Mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fundamental law of thought which underlies this mode
of proof was clearly recognized by Pythagoras. All harmony
and proportion and symmetry is the result of <i>unity</i> evolving
itself in and pervading <i>multiplicity</i>. Mind or reason is unity
and indivisibility; matter is diverse and multiple. Mind is
the determinating principle; matter is indeterminate and indefinite.
Confused matter receives form, and proportion, and
order, and symmetry, by the action and interpenetration of the
spiritual and indivisible element. In presence of facts of order,
the human reason instinctively and necessarily affirms the
presence and action of Mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="490" >490</a></span></p>

<p>"Pythagoras had long devoted his intellectual adoration to
the lofty idea of Order. To his mind it seemed as the presiding
genius of the serene and silent world. He had from his
youth dwelt with delight upon the eternal relations of space
and number, in which the very idea of proportion seems to find
its first and immediate development, until at length it seemed
as if the whole secret of the universe was hidden in these mysterious
correspondences. The world, in all its departments,
moral and material, is a living arithmetic in its development,
a realized geometry in its repose; it is a '<i>cosmos</i>' (for the
word is Pythagorean), the expression of harmony, the manifestation
to sense of everlasting order; and the science of <i>numbers</i>
is the truest representation of its eternal laws." Therefore,
argued Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, as the reason
of man can perceive the relations of an eternal order in the
proportions of extension and number, the laws of proportion,
and symmetry, and harmony must inhere in a Divine reason,
an intelligent soul, which moves and animates the universe.
The harmonies of the world which address themselves to the
human mind must be the product of a Divine mind. The
world, in its real structure, must be the image and copy of that
divine proportion which the mind of man adores. It is the
sensible type of the Divinity, the outward and multiple development
of the Eternal Unity, the Eternal One--that is, God.</p>

<p>The same argument is elaborated by Plato in his philosophy
of beauty. God is with him the last reason, the ultimate foundation,
the perfect ideal of all beauty--of all the order, proportion,
harmony, sublimity, and excellence which reigns in the
physical, the intellectual, and the moral world. He is the
"Eternal Beauty, unbegotten and imperishable, exempt from
all decay as well as increase--the perfect--the Divine Beauty"<a id="footnotetag892" name="footnotetag892"></a>
<a href="#footnote892"><sup class="sml">892</sup></a>

<p>(3.) The Teleological proof, or the argument based upon
the principle of intentionality or Final Cause, and is presented
in the following form:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="491" >491</a></span>

<blockquote>
<p>    The choice and adaptation of means to the accomplishment
    of special ends supposes an intelligent purpose, a Designing
    Mind.</p>

<p>    In the universe we see such choice and adaptation of
    means to ends.</p>

<p>    Therefore, the universe is the product of an intelligent,
    personal Cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is peculiarly the Socratic proof. He recognized the
necessity and the irresistibility of the conviction that the choice
and adaptation of means to ends is the effect of Purpose, the
expression of Will.<a id="footnotetag893" name="footnotetag893"></a>
<a href="#footnote893"><sup class="sml">893</sup></a> There is an obviousness and a directness
in this mode of argument which is felt by every human mind.
In the "Memorabilia" Xenophon has preserved a conversation
of Socrates with Aristodemus in which he develops this proof
at great length. In reading the dialogue<a id="footnotetag894" name="footnotetag894"></a>
<a href="#footnote894"><sup class="sml">894</sup></a> in which Socrates
instances the adaptation of our organization to the external
world, and the examples of design in the human frame, we
are forcibly reminded of the chapters of Paley, Whewell, and
M'Cosh. Well might Aristodemus exclaim: "The more I
consider it, the more it is evident to me that man must be the
masterpiece of some great Artificer, carrying along with it infinite
marks of the love and favor of Him who has thus formed
it." The argument from Final Causes is pursued by Plato in
the "Timæus;" and in Aristotle, God is the Final Cause of all
things.<a id="footnotetag895" name="footnotetag895"></a>

<p>(4.) The Ontological or Ideological proof, or the argument
grounded on necessary and absolute ideas, which may be
thrown into the following syllogism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>    Every attribute or quality implies a subject, and absolute
    modes necessarily suppose an Absolute Being.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="492" >492</a></span>
    Necessary and absolute truths or ideas are revealed in
    human reason as absolute modes.</p>

<p>    Therefore universal, necessary, and absolute ideas are
    modes of the absolute subject--that is, God, the foundation
    and source of all truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the Platonic proof. Plato recognized the principle
of substance (οὐσία--ὑποκείµενον), and therefore he proceeds in
the "Timæus" to inquire for the real ground of all existence;
and in the "Republic," for the real ground of all truth and
certitude.</p>

<p>The universe consists of two parts, permanent existences
and transient phenomena--being and genesis; the one eternally
constant, the other mutable and subject to change; the
former apprehended by the reason, the latter perceived by
sense. For each of these there must be a principle, subject, or
substratum--a principle or subject-matter, which is the ground
or condition of the sensible world, and a principle or substance,
which is the ground and reason of the intelligible world or
world of ideas. The subject-matter, or ground of the sensible
world, is "the receptacle" and "nurse" of forms, an "invisible
species and formless receiver (which is not earth, or air, or fire,
or water) which receives the immanence of the intelligible."<a id="footnotetag896" name="footnotetag896"></a>
<a href="#footnote896"><sup class="sml">896</sup></a>
The subject or ground of the intelligible world is that in which
ideal forms, or eternal archetypes inhere, and which impresses
form upon the transitional element, and fashions the world
after its own eternal models. This eternal and immutable substance
is God, who created the universe as a copy of the eternal
archetypes--the everlasting thoughts which dwell in his
infinite mind.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote896"
name="footnote896"><b>Footnote 896: </b></a><a href="#footnotetag896">
(return) </a> "Timæus," ch. xxiv.</blockquote>

<p>These copies of the eternal archetypes or models are perceived
by the reason of man in virtue of its participation in the
Ultimate Reason. The reason of man is the organ of truth;
by an innate and inalienable right, it grasps unseen and eternal
realities. The essence of the soul is akin to that which is
real, permanent, and eternal;--<i>It is the offspring and image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="493">493</a></span>
God</i>; therefore it has a true communion with the realities of
things, by virtue of this kindred and homogeneous nature. It
can, therefore, ascend from the universal and necessary ideas,
which are apprehended by the reason, to the absolute and
supreme Idea, which is the attribute and perfection of God.
When the human mind has contemplated any object of beauty,
any fact of order, proportion, harmony, and excellency, it may
rise to the notion of a quality common to all objects of beauty--from
a single beautiful body to two, from two to all others;
from beautiful bodies to beautiful sentiments, from beautiful
sentiments to beautiful thoughts, until, from thought to thought,
we arrive at the highest thought, which has no other object
than the perfect, absolute, <i>Divine Beauty</i>.<a id="footnotetag897" name="footnotetag897"></a>
<a href="#footnote897"><sup class="sml">897</sup></a> When a man has,
from the contemplation of instances of virtue, risen to the notion
of a quality common to all these instances, this quality
becomes the representative of an ineffable something which,
in the sphere of immutable reality, answers to the conception
in his soul. "At the extreme limits of the intellectual world
is the <i>Idea of the Good</i>, which is perceived with difficulty, but,
in fine, can not be perceived without concluding that it is the
source of all that is beautiful and good; that in the visible
world it produces light, and the star whence light directly
comes; that in the invisible world it directly produces truth
and intelligence."<a id="footnotetag898" name="footnotetag898"></a>

<p>The order in which these several methods of proof were
developed, will at once present itself to the mind of the reader
as the natural order of thought. The first and most obvious
aspect which nature presents to the opening mind is that of
movement and change--a succession of phenomena suggesting
the idea of <i>power</i>. Secondly, a closer attention reveals a resemblance
of phenomena among themselves, a uniformity of
nature--an order, proportion, and harmony pervading the <i>cosmos</i>,
which suggest an <i>identity and unity of power and of reason</i>,
pervading and controlling all things. Thirdly, a still closer
inspection of nature reveals a wonderful adaptation of means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="494">494</a></span>
to the fulfillment of special ends, of organs designed to fulfill
specific functions, suggesting the idea of <i>purpose</i>, <i>contrivance</i>,
and <i>choice</i>, and indicating that the power which moves and
determines the universe is a <i>personal</i>, <i>thinking</i>, and <i>voluntary</i>
agent. And fourthly, a profounder study of the nature of
thought, an analysis of personal consciousness, reveals that
there are necessary principles, ideas, and laws, which universally
govern and determine thought to definite and immovable
conceptions--as, for example, the principles of causality, of
substance, of identity or unity, of order, of intentionality; and
that it is only under these laws that we can conceive the universe.
By the law of substance we are compelled to regard
these ideas, which are not only laws of thought but also of
things, as inherent in a subject, or Being, who made all things,
and whose ideas are reflected in the reason of man. Thus
from universal and necessary ideas we rise to the <i>absolute Idea</i>,
from immutable principles to a <i>First Principle of all principles</i>,
a <i>First Thought</i> of all thoughts--that is, to <i>God</i>. This is the
history of the development of thought in the individual, and in
the race--<i>cause</i>, <i>order</i>, <i>design</i>, <i>idea</i>, <i>being</i>, GOD.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h3>THE PROPÆDEUTIC OFFICE OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY <i>(continued)</i>.</h3>

<p>
"If we regard this sublime philosophy as a preparation for Christianity
instead of seeking in it a substitute for the Gospel, we shall not need to
overstate its grandeur in order to estimate its real value."--Pressensé.</p>

<p>"Plato made me to know the true God. Jesus Christ showed me the
way to Him."--St. Augustine.
</p>

<p>The preparatory office of Grecian philosophy is also seen
in <i>the department of morals</i>.</p>

<p>I. <i>In the awakening and enthronement of Conscience as a law
of duty, and the elevation and purification of the Moral Idea</i>.</p>

<p>The same law of evolution, which we have seen governing
the history of speculative thought, may also be traced as determining
the progress of ethical inquiry. In this department
there are successive stages marked, both in the individual and
the national mind. There is, first, the simplicity and trust of
childhood, submitting with unquestioning faith to prescribed
and arbitrary laws; then the unsettled and ill-directed force
of youth, questioning the authority of laws, and asking reasons
why this or that is obligatory; then the philosophic wisdom of
riper years, recognizing an inherent law of duty, which has an
absolute rightness and an imperative obligation. There is
first a dim and shadowy apprehension of some lines of moral
distinction, and some consciousness of obligation, but these
rest mainly upon an outward law--the observed practice of
others, or the command of the parent as, in some sense, the
command of God. Then, to attain to personal convictions,
man passes through a stage of doubt; he asks for a ground of
obligation, for an authority that shall approve itself to his own
judgment and reason. At last he arrives at some ultimate
principles of right, some immutable standard of duty; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="496" >496</a></span>
recognizes an inward law of conscience, and it becomes to him as
the voice of God. He extends his analysis to history, and he
finds that the universal conscience of the race has, in all ages,
uttered the same behest. Should he live in Christian times,
he discovers a wondrous harmony between the voice of God
within the heart, and the voice of God within the pages of inspiration.
And now the convention of public opinion, and the
laws of the state, are revered and upheld by him, just so far as
they bear the imprimatur of reason and of conscience--that is,
of God.</p>

<p>This history of the normal development of the individual
mind has its counterpart in the history of humanity. There is
(1.) <i>The age of popular and unconscious morality</i>; (2.) <i>The transitional,
skeptical, or sophistical age</i>; and (3.) <i>The philosophic or
conscious age of morality</i>.<a id="footnotetag899" name="footnotetag899"></a>
<a href="#footnote899"><sup class="sml">899</sup></a> In the "Republic" of Plato, we
have these three eras represented by different persons, through
the course of the dialogue. The question is started--what is
Justice? and an answer is given from the stand-point of popular
morality, by Polemarchus, who quotes the words of the poet
Simonides,</p>

<p class="mid">"To give to each his due is just;"<a id="footnotetag900" name="footnotetag900"></a>
<a href="#footnote900"><sup class="sml">900</sup></a></p>

<p>that is, justice is paying your debts. This doctrine being
proved inadequate, an answer is given from the Sophistical
point of view by Thrasymachus, who defines justice as "the
advantage of the strongest"--that is, might is right, and right is
might.<a id="footnotetag901" name="footnotetag901"></a>
<a href="#footnote901"><sup class="sml">901</sup></a> This answer being sharply refuted, the way is opened
for a more philosophic account, which is gradually evolved in
book iv., Glaucon and Adimantus personifying the practical
understanding, which is gradually brought into harmony with
philosophy, and Socrates the higher reason, as the purely philosophic
conception. Justice is found to be the right proportion
and harmonious development of all the elements of the soul,
and the equal balance of all the interests of society, so as to
secure a well-regulated and harmonious whole.</p>

<p>The era of <i>popular and unconscious morality</i> is represented
by the times of Homer, Hesiod, the Gnomic poets, and "the
Seven Wise Men of Greece."</p>

<p>This was an age of instinctive action, rather than reflection--of
poetry and feeling, rather than analytic thought. The
rules of life were presented in maxims and proverbs, which do
not rise above prudential counsels or empirical deductions.
Morality was immediately associated with the religion of the
state, and the will of the gods was the highest law for men.
"Homer and Hesiod, and the Gnomic poets, constituted the
educational course," to which may be added the saws and
aphorisms of the Seven Wise Men, and we have before us the
main sources of Greek views of duty. When the question was
asked--"What is right?" the answer was given by a quotation
from Homer, Hesiod, Simonides, and the like. The morality
of Homer "is concrete, not abstract; it expresses the conception
of a heroic life, rather than a philosophic theory. It is
mixed up with a religion which really consists in a celebration
of the beauty of nature, and in a deification of the strong and
brilliant qualities of human nature. It is a morality uninfluenced
by a regard for a future life. It clings with intense
enjoyment and love to the present world, and the state after
death looms up in the distance as a cold and repugnant shadow.
And yet it would often hold death preferable to disgrace.
The distinction between a noble and ignoble life is strongly
marked in Homer, and yet a sense of right and wrong about
particular actions seems fluctuating" and confused.<a id="footnotetag902" name="footnotetag902"></a>
<a href="#footnote902"><sup class="sml">902</sup></a> A sensuous
conception of happiness is the chief good, and mere
temporal advantage the principal reward of virtue. We hear
nothing of the approving smile of conscience, of inward self-satisfaction,

because they secure temporal good. And yet, with all
this imperfection, the poets present "a remarkable picture of
primitive simplicity, chastity, justice, and practical piety, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="498" >498</a></span>

<p>The <i>transitional, skeptical</i>, or <i>sophistical era</i> begins with Protagoras.
Poetry and proverbs had ceased to satisfy the reason
of man. The awakening intellect had begun to call in question
the old maxims and "wise saws," to dispute the arbitrary
authority of the poets, and even to arraign the institutions of
society. It had already begun to seek for some reasonable
foundation of authority for the opinions, customs, laws, and institutions
which had descended to them from the past, and to
ask why men were obliged to do this or that? The question
whether there is at bottom any real difference between truth
and error, right and wrong, was now fairly before the human
mind. The ultimate standard of all truth and all right, was
now the grand object of pursuit. These inquiries were not,
however, conducted by the Sophists with the best motives.
They were not always prompted by an earnest desire to know
the truth, and an earnest purpose to embrace and do the right.
They talked and argued for mere effect--to display their dialectic
subtilty, or their rhetorical power. They taught virtue
for mere emolument and pay. They delighted, as Cicero tells
us, to plead the opposite sides of a cause with equal effect.
And they found exquisite pleasure in raising difficulties, maintaining
paradoxes, and passing off mere tricks of oratory for
solid proofs. This is the uniform representation of the sophistical
spirit which is given by all the best writers who lived
nearest to their times, and who are, therefore, to be presumed
to have known them best. Grote<a id="footnotetag904" name="footnotetag904"></a>
<a href="#footnote904"><sup class="sml">904</sup></a> has made an elaborate defense
of the Sophists; he charges Plato with gross misrepresentation.
His portraits of them are denounced as mere caricatures,
prompted by a spirit of antagonism; all antiquity is presumed
to have been misled by him. No one, however, can
read Grant's "Essay on the History of Moral Philosophy in
Greece"<a id="footnotetag905" name="footnotetag905"></a>
<a href="#footnote905"><sup class="sml">905</sup></a> without feeling that his vindication of Plato is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="499" >499</a></span>
complete and unanswerable: "Plato never represents the Sophists
as teaching a lax morality to their disciples. He does not
make sophistry to consist in holding wicked opinions; he represents
them as only too orthodox in general,<a id="footnotetag906" name="footnotetag906"></a>
<a href="#footnote906"><sup class="sml">906</sup></a> but capable of
giving utterance to immoral paradoxes for the sake of vanity.
Sophistry rather tampers and trifles with the moral convictions
than directly attacks them." The Sophists were wanting in
deep conviction, in moral earnestness, in sincere love of truth,
in reverence for goodness and purity, and therefore their trifling,
insincere, and paradoxical teaching was unfavorable to
goodness of life. The tendency of their method is forcibly depicted
in the words of Plato: "There are certain dogmas relating
to what is <i>just</i> and <i>good</i> in which we have been brought
up from childhood--obeying and reverencing them. Other
opinions recommending pleasure and license we resist, out of
respect for the old hereditary maxims. Well, then, a question
comes up concerning what is right? He gives some answer
such as he has been taught, and straightway is refuted. He
tries again, and is again refuted. And, when this has happened
pretty often, he is reduced to the opinion that <i>nothing is
either right or wrong</i>; and in the same way it happens about
the just and the good, and all that before we have held in
reverence. On this, he naturally abandons his allegiance to
the old principles and takes up with those he before resisted,
and so, from being a good citizen, he becomes lawless."<a id="footnotetag907" name="footnotetag907"></a>
<a href="#footnote907"><sup class="sml">907</sup></a> And,
in point of fact, this was the theoretical landing-place of the
Sophists. We do not say they became practically "lawless"
and antinomian, but they did arrive at the settled opinion that
right and wrong, truth and error, are solely matter of private
opinion and conventional usage. Man's own fluctuating opinion
is the measure and standard of all things.<a id="footnotetag908" name="footnotetag908"></a>

<p>The age of the Sophists was a transitional period--a necessary,
though, in itself considered, an unhappy stage in the progress
of the human mind; but it opened the way for,
<i>The Socratic, philosophic</i>, or <i>conscious age of morals</i>. It has
been said that "before Socrates there was no morality in
Greece, but only propriety of conduct." If by this is meant
that prior to Socrates men simply followed the maxims of
"the Theologians,"<a id="footnotetag911" name="footnotetag911"></a>
<a href="#footnote911"><sup class="sml">911</sup></a> and obeyed the laws of the state, without
reflection and inquiry as to the intrinsic character of the acts,
and without any analysis and exact definition, so as to attain
to principles of ultimate and absolute right, it must be accepted
as true--there was no philosophy of morals. Socrates is therefore
justly regarded as "the father of moral philosophy." Aristotle
says that he confined himself chiefly to ethical inquiries.
He sought a determinate conception and an exact definition of
virtue. As Xenophon has said of him, "he never ceased asking,
What is piety? what is impiety? what is noble? what is
base? what is just? what is unjust? what is temperance? what
is madness?"<a id="footnotetag912" name="footnotetag912"></a>
<a href="#footnote912"><sup class="sml">912</sup></a> And these questions were not asked in the
Sophistic spirit, as a dialectic exercise, or from idle curiosity.
He was a perfect contrast to the Sophists. They had slighted
Truth, he made her the mistress of his soul. They had turned
away from her, he longed for more perfect communion with
her. They had deserted her for money and renown, he was
faithful to her in poverty.<a id="footnotetag913" name="footnotetag913"></a>
<a href="#footnote913"><sup class="sml">913</sup></a> He wanted to know what piety
was, that he might be pious. He desired to know what justice,
temperance, nobility, courage were, that he might cultivate
and practise them. He wrote no books, delivered no lectures;
he instituted no school; he simply conversed in the shop, the
market-place, the banquet-hall, and the prison. This philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="501" >501</a></span>
was not so much a <i>doctrine</i> as a <i>life</i>. "What is remarkable
in him is not the <i>system</i> but the <i>man</i>. The memory he left behind
him amongst his disciples, though idealized--the affection,
blended with reverence, which they never ceased to feel
for his person, bear testimony to the elevation of his character
and his moral purity. We recognize in him a Greek of Athens--one
who had imbibed many dangerous errors, and on whom
the yoke of pagan custom still weighed; but his life was nevertheless
a noble life; and it is to calumny we must have recourse
if we are to tarnish its beauty by odious insinuations, as
Lucian did, and as has been too frequently done, after him, by
unskillful defenders of Christianity,<a id="footnotetag914" name="footnotetag914"></a>
<a href="#footnote914"><sup class="sml">914</sup></a> who imagine it is the
gainer by all that degrades human nature. Born in a humble
position, destitute of all the temporal advantages which the
Greeks so passionately loved, Socrates exerted a kingship over
minds. His dominion was the more real for being less apparent....
His power consisted of three things: his devoted
affection for his disciples, his disinterested love of truth, and
the perfect harmony of his life and doctrine.... If he recommended
temperance and sobriety, he also set the example;
poorly clad, satisfied with little, he disdained all the delicacies
of life. He possessed every species of courage. On the field
of battle he was intrepid, and still more intrepid when he resisted
the caprices of the multitude who demanded of him,
when he was a senator, to commit the injustice of summoning
ten generals before the tribunals. He also infringed the iniquitous
orders of the thirty tyrants of Athens. The satires of
Aristophanes neither moved nor irritated him. The same
dauntless firmness he displayed when brought before his
judges, charged with impiety. 'If it is your wish to absolve
me on condition that I henceforth be silent, I reply I love and
honor you, but I ought rather to obey the gods than you. Neither
in the presence of judges nor of the enemy is it permitted
me, or any other man, to use every sort of means to escape
death. It is not death but crime that it is difficult to avoid;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="502" >502</a></span>
crime moves faster than death. So I, old and heavy as I am,
have allowed myself to be overtaken by death, while my accusers,
light and vigorous, have allowed themselves to be overtaken
by the light-footed crime. I go, then, to suffer death;
they to suffer shame and iniquity. I abide by my punishment,
as they by theirs. All is according to order.' It was the same
fidelity to duty that made Socrates refuse to escape from prison,
in order not to violate the laws of his country, to which, even
though irritated, more respect is due than to a father. 'Let us
walk in the path,' he says 'that God has traced for us.' These
last words show the profound religious sentiment which animated
Socrates.... It is impossible not to feel that there was
something divine in such a life crowned with such a death."<a id="footnotetag915" name="footnotetag915"></a>

<p>Socrates laid the foundation for conscious morality by
placing the ground of right and wrong in an eternal and unchangeable
reason which illuminates the reason and conscience
of every man. He often asserted that morality is a science
which can not be taught. It depends mainly upon principles
which are discovered by an inward light. Accordingly he regarded
it as the main business of education to "draw out" into
the light of consciousness the principles of right and justice
which are infolded within the conscience of man--to deliver
the mind of the secret truth which was striving towards the
light of day. Therefore he called his method the "maieutic"
or "obstetric" art. He felt there was something divine in all
men (answering to his <i>τὸ δαιµόνιον</i> or <i>δαιµόνιον τι</i>--a divine
and supernatural something--a warning "voice"--a gnomic
"sign"--a "law of God written on the heart"), which by a system
of skillful interrogations he sought to elicit, so that each
might hear for himself the voice of God, and, hearing, might
obey. Thus was he the "great prophet of the human conscience,"
and a messenger of God to the heathen world, to prepare
the way of the Lord.</p>

<p>The morality of conscience was carried to its highest point
by Plato. From the moment he became the disciple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="503">503</a></span>
Socrates he sympathized deeply with the spirit and the method of
his master. He had the same deep seriousness of spirit, that
same earnestness of purpose, that same inward reverence for
justice, and purity, and goodness, which dwelt in the heart of
Socrates. A naturally noble nature, he loved truth with all
the glow and fervor of his young heart. He felt that if any
thing gave meaning and value to life, it must be the contemplation
of absolute truth, absolute beauty, and absolute Good.
This absolute Good is God, who is the first principle of all
ideas, the fountain of all the order and proportion and beauty
of the universe, the source of all the good which exists in
nature and in man. To practise goodness--to conform the
character to the eternal models of order, proportion, and excellence,
is to resemble God. To aspire after perfection of
moral being, to secure assimilation to God (όµοίωσις θεῷ) is the
noble aspiration of Plato's soul.</p>

<p>When we read the "Gorgias," the "Philebus," and especially
the "Republic," with what noble joy are we filled on hearing the
voice of conscience, like a harp swept by a seraph's hand, uttering
such deep-toned melodies! How does he drown the clamors
of passion, the calculations of mere expediency, the sophism
of mere personal interest and utility. If he calls us to witness
the triumph of the wicked in the first part of the "Republic," it
is in order that we may at the end of the book see the deceitfulness
of their triumph. "As to the wicked," he says, "I
maintain that even if they succeed at first in concealing what
they are, most of them betray themselves at the end of their
career. They are covered with opprobrium, and present evils
are nothing compared with those that <i>await them in the other
life</i>. As to the just man, whether in sickness or in poverty,
these imaginary evils will turn to his advantage in this life, <i>and
after his death</i>; because the providence of the gods is necessarily
attentive to the interests of him who labors to become
just, and to attain, by the practice of virtue, to the most perfect
resemblance to God which is possible to man."<a id="footnotetag916" name="footnotetag916"></a>
<a href="#footnote916"><sup class="sml">916</sup></a> He rises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="504" >504</a></span>
above all "greatest happiness principles," and asserts distinctly
in the "Gorgias" that it is better to suffer wrong than to do
wrong.<a id="footnotetag917" name="footnotetag917"></a>
<a href="#footnote917"><sup class="sml">917</sup></a> "I maintain," says he, "that what is most shameful
is not to be struck unjustly on the cheek, or to be wounded in
the body; but that to strike and wound me unjustly, to rob
me, or reduce me to slavery--to commit, in a word, any kind
of injustice towards me, or what is mine--is a thing far worse
and more odious for him who commits the injustice, than for
me who suffer it."<a id="footnotetag918" name="footnotetag918"></a>
<a href="#footnote918"><sup class="sml">918</sup></a> It is a great combat, he says, greater than
we think, that wherein the issue is whether we shall be virtuous
or wicked. Neither glory, nor riches, nor dignities, nor
poetry, deserves that we should neglect justice for them. The
moral idea in Plato has such intense truth and force, that it
has at times a striking analogy with the language of the Holy
Scriptures.<a id="footnotetag919" name="footnotetag919"></a>

<p>The obligation of moral rectitude is, by Plato, derived from
the authoritative utterances of conscience as the voice of God.
We must do right because reason and conscience say it is right.
In the "Euthyphron" he maintains that the moral quality of
actions is not dependent on the arbitrary will of a Supreme
Governor;--"an act is not holy because the gods love it, but
the gods love it because it is holy." The eternal law of right
dwells in the Eternal Reason of God, the idea of right in all
human minds is a ray of that Eternal Reason; and the requirement
of the divine law that we shall do right is, and must be,
in harmony with both.</p>

<p>The present life is regarded by Plato as a state of probation
and discipline, the future life as one of reward and punishment.<a id="footnotetag920" name="footnotetag920"></a>

<p>Plato was thus to the heathen world "the great apostle of
the moral idea;" he followed up and completed the work of
Socrates. "The voice of God, that still found a profound echo
in man's heart, possessed in him an organ to which all Greece
gave ear; and the austere revelation of conscience this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="505" >505</a></span>
embodied in language too harmonious not to entice by the
beauty of form, a nation of artists, they received it. The tables
of the eternal law, carved in purest marble and marvellously
sculptured, were read by them."</p>

<p>In Plato both the theistic conception and the moral idea
seem to have touched the zenith. The philosophy of Aristotle,
considered as a whole, appears on one side to have passed the
line of the great Hellenic period. If it did not inaugurate, it
at least prepared the way for the decline. It perfected logic,
as the instrument of ratiocination, and gave it exactness and
precision, Yet taken all in all, it was greatly inferior to its
predecessor. From the moral point of view it is a decided retrogression.
The god of Aristotle is indifferent to virtue. He
is pure thought rather than moral perfection. He takes no
cognizance of man. Morality has no eternal basis, no divine
type, and no future reward. Therefore Aristotle's philosophy
had little power over the conscience and heart.</p>

<p>During the grand Platonic period human reason made its
loftiest flight, it rose aloft and soared towards heaven, but alas!
its wings, like those of Icarus, melted in the sun and it fell to
earth again. Instead of wax it needed the strong "eagle pinions
of faith" which revelation only can supply. The decadence
is strongly marked both in the Epicurean and Stoic
schools. They both express the feeling of exhaustion, disappointment,
and despair. The popular theology had lost its
hold upon the public mind. The gods no longer visited the
earth. "The mysterious voice which, according to the poetic
legend related by Plutarch, was heard out at sea--'Great Pan
is dead'--rose up from every heart; the voice of an incredulous
age proclaimed the coming end of paganism. The oracles
were dumb." There was no vision in the land. All faith in a
beneficent overruling Providence was lost, and the hope of immortality
was well-nigh gone. The doctrines of a resurrection
and a judgment to come, were objects of derisive mockery.<a id="footnotetag921" name="footnotetag921"></a>
<a href="#footnote921"><sup class="sml">921</sup></a>
Philosophy directed her attention solely to the problem of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="506" >506</a></span>
individual well-being on earth; it became simply a philosophy
of life, and not, as with Plato, "a preparation for death." The
grosser minds sought refuge in the doctrines of Epicurus.
They said, "Pleasure is the chief good, the end of life is to enjoy
yourself;" to this end "dismiss the fear of gods, and, above
all, the fear of death." The nobler souls found an asylum with
the Stoics. They said, "Fata nos ducunt--The Fates lead us!
Live conformable to reason. Endure and abstain!" Notwithstanding
numerous and serious errors, the ethical system
of the Stoics was wonderfully pure. This must be confessed
by any one who reads the "Enchiridion" of Epictetus, and the
"Meditations" of Aurelius. "The highest end of life is to contemplate
truth and to obey the Eternal Reason. God is to be
reverenced above all things, and universally submitted to. The
noblest office of reason is to subjugate passion and conduct to
virtue. Virtue is the supreme good, which is to be pursued for
its own sake, and not from fear or hope. That is sufficient for
happiness which is seated only in the mind, and therefore independent
of external things. The consciousness of well-doing
is reward enough without the applause of others. And no fear
of loss, or pain, or even death, must be suffered to turn us aside
from truth and virtue."<a id="footnotetag922" name="footnotetag922"></a>

<p>The preparatory office of Christianity in the field of ethics is
further seen,</p>

<p>II. <i>In the fact that, by an experiment conducted on the largest
scale, it demonstrated the insufficiency of reason to elaborate a perfect
ideal of moral excellence, and develop the moral forces necessary
to secure its realization</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that the moral idea in Socrates, Plato, Epictetus,
Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca rose to a sublime height, and
that, under its influence, they developed a noble and heroic
character. At the same time it must be conceded that their
ethical system was marked by signal blemishes and radical defects.
After all its excellence, it did not give roundness, completeness,
and symmetry to moral life. The elements which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="507">507</a></span>
really purify and ennoble man, and lend grace and beauty to
life, were utterly wanting. Their systems were rather a discipline
of the reason than a culture of the heart. The reason
held in check the lower passions and propensities of the nature
but it did not evoke the softer, gentler, purer emotions of the
soul. The cardinal virtues of the ancient ethical systems are
Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Courage, all which are in
the last analysis reduced to Wisdom. Humility, Meekness,
Forgiveness of injuries, Love of even enemies, Universal Benevolence,
Real Philanthropy, the graces which give beauty to
character and bless society, are scarcely known. It is true
that in Epictetus and Seneca we have some counsels to humility,
to forbearance, and forgiveness; but it must be borne in
mind that Christianity was now in the air, exerting an indirect
influence beyond the limits of the labors of the indefatigable
missionaries of the Cross.<a id="footnotetag923" name="footnotetag923"></a>
<a href="#footnote923"><sup class="sml">923</sup></a> By their predecessors, these qualities
were disparaged rather than upheld. Resentment of injuries
was applauded as a virtue, and meekness was proclaimed
a defect and a weakness. They knew nothing of a forgiving
spirit, and were strangers to the charity "which endureth all
things, hopeth all things, and never fails." The enlarged philanthrophy
which overleaps the bounds of kindred and nationality,
and embraces a common humanity in its compassionate
regards and benevolent efforts, was unknown. Socrates, the
noblest of all the Grecians, was in no sense cosmopolitan in his
feeling. His whole nature and character wore a Greek impress.
He could scarce be tempted to go beyond the gates of Athens,
and his care was all for the Athenian people. He could not
conceive an universal philanthropy. Plato, in his solicitude
to reduce his ideal state to a harmonious whole, answering to
his idea of Justice, sacrificed the individual. He superseded
private property, broke up the sacred relations of family and
home, degraded woman, and tolerated slavery. Selfishness
was to be overcome, and political order maintained, by a rigid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="508" >508</a></span>
communism. To harmonize individual rights and national interests,
was the wisdom reserved for the fishermen of Galilee.
The whole method of Plato's "Politeia," breathes the spirit of
legalism in all its severity, untempered by the spirit of Love.
This was the living force which was wanting to give energy to
the ideals of the reason and conscience, to furnish high motive
to virtue, to prompt to deeds of heroic sacrifice and suffering
for the good of others; and this could not be inspired by philosophy,
nor constrained by legislation. This love must descend
from above. "The Platonic love" was a mere intellectual
appreciation of beauty, and order, and proportion, and excellence.
It was not the love of man as the offspring and
image of God, as the partaker of a common nature, and the
heir of a common immortality. Such love was first revealed
on earth by the incarnate Son of God, and can only be attained
by human hearts under the inspiration of his teaching and life,
and the renewing influence of the Holy Spirit. "Love is of
God, and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth
God." To "love our neighbor as ourself" is the golden precept
of the Son of God, who is incarnate Love. The equality
of all men as "the offspring of God" had been nominally recognized
by the Stoic philosophers; its realization had been
rendered possible to the popular thought by Roman conquest,
law, and jurisprudence; these had prepared the way for its
fullest announcement and practical recognition by the world.
At this providential juncture St. Paul appears on Mars' Hill,
and in the presence of the assembled philosophers proclaims,
"<i>God hath made of one blood all nations of men</i>." A lofty ideal
of moral excellence had been attained by Plato--the conception
of a high and inflexible morality, which contrasted most
vividly with the depravity which prevailed in Athenian society.
The education "of the public assemblies, the courts, the theatres,
or wherever the multitude gathered" was unfavorable to
virtue. And the inadequacy of all mere human teaching to resist
this current of evil, and save the young men of the age from
ruin, is touchingly and mournfully confessed by Plato. "There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="509" >509</a></span>
is not, there never was, there never will be a moral education
possible that can countervail the education of which these are
the dispensers; that is, <i>human</i> education: I except, with the

<p>In the department of <i>religious feeling</i> and <i>sentiment</i>, the

<p>During the period of unconscious and unreflective theism,
the sentiment of the Divine was one of objective nearness and
personal intimacy. The gods interposed directly in the affairs
of men, and held frequent and familiar intercourse with our
race. They descend to the battle-field of Troy, and mingle in
the bloody strife. They grace the wedding-feast by their presence,
and heighten the gladness with celestial music. They
visit the poor and the stranger, and sometimes clothe the old
and shrivelled beggar with celestial beauty. They inspire their
favorites with strength and courage, and fill their mouths with
wisdom and eloquence. They manifest their presence by signs
and wonders, by visions and dreams, by auguries and prophetic
voices. But more frequently than all, they are seen in the
ordinary phenomena of nature, the sunshine and storm, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="510">510</a></span>
winds and tempests, the hail and rain. The natural is, in fact,
the supernatural, and all the changes of nature are the movement
and action of the Divine. The feeling of dependence is
immediate and universal, and worship is the natural and spontaneous
act of man.</p>

<p>But the period of reflection is inevitable. Man turns his
inquiring gaze towards nature and desires, by an imperfect
effort of physical induction, to reach "the first principle and
cause of things." Soon he discovers the prevalence of uniformity
in nature, the actions of physical properties and agencies,
and he catches some glimpses of the reign of universal
law. The natural tendency of this discovery is obvious in the
weakening of his sense of dependence on the immediate agency
of God. The Egyptians told Herodotus that, as their fields
were regularly irrigated by the waters of the Nile, they were
less dependent on God than the Greeks, whose lands were
watered by rains, and who must perish if Jupiter did not send
them showers.<a id="footnotetag927" name="footnotetag927"></a>
<a href="#footnote927"><sup class="sml">927</sup></a> As man advances in the field of mere physical
inquiry, God recedes; from the region of explained phenomena,
he retires into the region of unexplained phenomena--the
border-land of mystery. The gods are driven from the woods
and streams, the winds and waves. Neptune does not absolutely
control the seas, nor Æolus the winds. The Divine
becomes, no more a physical ἀρχή--a nature-power, but a Supreme
Mind, an ineffable Spirit, an invisible God, the Supreme
Essence of Essences, the Supreme Idea of Ideas (εἶδος αὐτὸ
καθ᾿ αὑτό) apprehended by human reason alone, but having an
independent, eternal, substantial, personal being. Through
the instrumentality of Platonism, the idea of God becomes
clearer and purer. Man had learned that communion with
the Divinity was something more than an apotheosis of humanity,
or a pantheistic absorption. He caught glimpses of a
higher and holier union. He had surrendered the ideal of a
national communion with God, and of personal protection
through a federal religion, and now was thrown back upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="511" >511</a></span>
himself to find some channel of personal approach to God.
But alas! he could not find it. A God so vastly elevated beyond
human comprehension, who could only be apprehended
by the most painful effort of abstract thought; a God so infinitely
removed from man by the purity and rectitude of his
character; a God who was all pure reason, seemed alien to all
the yearnings and sympathies of the human heart; and such
a God, dwelling in pure light, seemed inapproachable and
inacessible to man.<a id="footnotetag928" name="footnotetag928"></a>
<a href="#footnote928"><sup class="sml">928</sup></a>The purifying of the religious idea had
evoked a new ideal, and this ideal was painfully remote. By
the energy of abstract thought man had striven to pierce the
veil, and press into "the Holy of Holies," to come into the
presence of God, and he had failed. And he had sought by
moral discipline, by self-mortification, by inward purification,
to raise himself to that lofty plane of purity, where he might
catch some glimpses of the vision of a holy God, and still he
failed. Nay, more, he had tried the power of prayer. Socrates,
and Plato, and Cleanthes had bowed the knee and moved
the lips in prayer. The emperor Aurelius, and the slave Epictetus
had prayed, and prayer, no doubt, intensified their longing,
and sharpened and agonized their desire, but it did not
raise them to a satisfying and holy <i>koinonia</i> in the divine life.

that she removed the mist from before the eyes of Diomede,</p>

<a href="#footnote930"><sup class="sml">930</sup></a> Man
was brought, through a period of discipline, to feel his need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="512" >512</a></span>
of a personal relation to God. He was made to long for a
realizing sense of his presence--to desire above all things a
Father, a Counsellor, and a Friend--a living ear into which
he might groan his anguish, or hymn his joy; and a living
heart that could beat towards him in compassion, and prompt
immediate succor and aid. The idea of a pure Spiritual Essence
without form, and without emotion, pervading all, and
transcending all, is too vague and abstract to yield us comfort,
and to exert over us any persuasive power. "Our moral
weakness shrinks from it in trembling awe. The heart can

Hence the need and the desire that God shall condescendingly
approach to man, and by some manifestation of himself in
human form, and through the sensibilities of the human heart,
commend himself to the heart of man--in other words, the
need of an <i>Incarnation</i>. Thus did the education of our race,
by the dispensation of philosophy, prepare the way for him
who was consciously or unconsciously "<i>the Desire of Nations</i>,"
and the deepening earnestness and spiritual solicitude of the
heathen world heralded the near approach of Him who was not
only "the Hope of Israel" but "the Saviour of the world."</p>

Jews. So that Virgil, the Roman poet, who was contemporary

<p>II. <i>Finally, Greek philosophy prepared the way for Christianity
by awakening and deepening the consciousness of guilt, and the desire
for Redemption</i>.</p>

<p>The consciousness of sin, and the consequent need of expiation
for sin, were gradually unfolded in the Greek mind. The
idea of sin was at first revealed in a confused and indefinite
feeling of some external, supernatural, and bewildering influence
which man can not successfully resist; but yet so in harmony
with the sinner's inclination, that he can not divest himself of
all responsibility. "Homer has no word answering in comprehensiveness
or depth of meaning to the word <i>sin</i>, as it is used
in the Bible..... The noun <i>ἁµαρτία</i> which is appropriated to
express this idea in the Greek of the New Testament, does not
occur in the Homeric poems..... The word which is most
frequently employed to express wrong-doing of every kind is
<i>ἄτη</i>, with its corresponding verb..... The radical signification
of the word seems to be a befooling--a depriving one of his
senses and his reason, as by unseasonable sleep, and excess
of wine, joined with the influence of evil companions, and the
power of destiny, or the deity. Hence, the Greek imagination,
which impersonated every great power, very naturally
conceived of  Ἄτη as a person, a sort of omnipresent and universal
cause of folly and sin, of mischief and misery, who,
though the daughter of Jupiter, yet once fooled or misled Jupiter
himself, and thenceforth, cast down from heaven to earth,
walks with light feet over the heads of men, and makes all
things go wrong. Hence, too, when men come to their senses,
and see what folly and wrong they have perpetrated, they cast
the blame on Ἄτη, and so, ultimately, on Jupiter and the
gods."<a id="footnotetag933" name="footnotetag933"></a>

<p>And yet, though Agamemnon here attempts to shuffle off the
guilt of his transgression upon Até, Jove, and Fate, yet at other
times he confesses his folly and wrong, and makes no attempt

<a href="#footnote935"><sup class="sml">935</sup></a> Though misled by a

<p>To satisfy the demands of divine justice, to show its hatred
of sin, and to deter others from transgression, sin is punished.
Punishment is the penalty due to sin; in the language of
Homer, it is the payment of a debt incurred by sin. When the
transgressor is punished he is said to "pay off," or "pay back"
his crimes; in other words, to expatiate or atone for them.</p>

<p>Polytheism, then, as Dr. Schaff has remarked, had the voice

<p>But after the law comes the gospel. First the controversy,
then the reconciliation. A dim consciousness of sin and retribution
as a fact, and of reconciliation as a <i>want</i>, seems to have
revealed itself even in the darkest periods of history. This
consciousness underlies not a few of the Greek tragedies.
"The 'Prometheus Bound' was followed by the 'Prometheus
Unbound,' reconciled and restored through the intervention of
Jove's son. The 'Œdipus Tyrannus' of Sophocles was completed
by the 'Œdipus Colonus,' where he dies in peace amid
tokens of divine favor. And so the 'Agamemnon' and 'Choephoroe'
reach their consummation only in the 'Eumenides,'
where the Erinyes themselves are appeased, and the Furies become
the gracious ones. This is not, however, without a special
divine interposition, and then only after a severe struggle between
the powers that cry for justice and those that plead for
mercy."</p>

<p>The office and work which, in this trilogy, is assigned to
Jove's son, Apollo, must strike every reader as at least a remarkable
resemblance, if not a foreshadowing of the Christian
doctrine of <i>reconciliation</i>. "This becomes yet more striking
when we bring into view the relation in which this reconciling
work stands to Ζεὺς Σωτήρ, Jupiter Saviour--Ζεὺς τρίτος, Jupiter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="517" >517</a></span>
the third, who, in connection with Apollo and Athena, consummates

<p>Platonism reveals a still closer affinity with Christianity in its
doctrine of sin, and its sense of the need of salvation. Plato
is sacredly jealous for the honor and purity of the divine character,
and rejects with indignation every hypothesis which would
make God the author of sin. "God, inasmuch as he is good,
can not be the cause of all things, as the common doctrine
represents him to be. On the contrary, he is the author of only
a small part of human affairs; of the larger part he is not the
author; for our evil things far outnumber our good things.
The good things we must ascribe to God, whilst we must seek
elsewhere, and not in him, the causes of evil."<a id="footnotetag956" name="footnotetag956"></a>

<p>Whatever in the writings of Homer and the tragic poets give
countenance to the notion that God is, in the remotest sense
the author of sin, must be expunged. Here is clearly a great
advance in ethical conceptions.</p>

<p>The great defect in the ethical system of Plato was the
identification of evil with the inferior or corporeal nature of
man--"the irascible and concupiscible elements," fashioned by
the junior divinities. The rational and immortal part of man's
nature, which is derived immediately from God--the Supreme
Good, naturally chooses the good as its supreme end and destination.
Hence he adopted the Socratic maxim "that no man
is willingly evil," that is, no man deliberately chooses evil as
evil, but only as a <i>seeming</i> good--he does not choose evil as
an end, though he may choose it voluntarily as a means. Plato
manifests great solicitude to guard this maxim from misconception
and abuse. Man has, in his judgment, the power to
act in harmony with his higher reason, or contrary to reason;
to obey the voice of conscience or the clamors of passion, and
consequently he is the object of praise or blame, reward or
punishment. "When a man does not consider himself, but
others, as the cause of his own sins,.... and even seeks to excuse
himself from blame, he dishonors and injures his own
soul; so, also, when contrary to reason.... he indulges in pleasure,
he dishonors it by filling it with vice and remorse."<a id="footnotetag959" name="footnotetag959"></a>
<a href="#footnote959"><sup class="sml">959</sup></a> The
work and effort of life, the end of this probationary economy,
is to make reason triumphant over passion, and discipline ourselves
to a purer and nobler life.</p>

<p>The obstacles to a virtuous life are, however, confessedly
numberless, and, humanly speaking, insurmountable. To raise
one's self above the clamor of passion, the power of evil, the
bondage of the flesh, is acknowledged, in mournful language,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="519">519</a></span>
to be a hopeless task. A cloud of sadness shades the brow of
Plato as he contemplates the fallen state of man. In the
"Phædrus" he describes, in gorgeous imagery, the purity, and
beauty, and felicity of the soul in its anterior and primeval
state, when, charioteering through the highest arch of heaven
in company with the Deity, it contemplated the divine justice
and beauty; but "this happy life," says he, "we forfeited by
our transgression." Allured by strange affections, our souls
forgot the sacred things that we were made to contemplate and
love--we <i>fell</i>. And now, in our fallen state, the soul has lost
its pristine beauty and excellence. It has become more disfigured
than was Glaucus, the seaman "whose primitive form
was not recognizable, so disfigured had he become by his long
dwelling in the sea."<a id="footnotetag960" name="footnotetag960"></a>
<a href="#footnote960"><sup class="sml">960</sup></a> To restore this lost image of the good,--to
regain "this primitive form," is not the work of man, but
God. Man can not save himself. "Virtue is not natural to
man, neither is it to be learned, but it comes by a divine influence.
<i>Virtue, is the gift of God</i>."<a id="footnotetag961" name="footnotetag961"></a>
<a href="#footnote961"><sup class="sml">961</sup></a> He needs a discipline, "an

<p>Plato was, in some way, able to discover the need of a
Saviour, to desire a Saviour, but he could not predict his
appearing. Hints are obscurely given of a Conqueror of sin,
an Assuager of pain, an Averter of evil in this life, and of the
impending retributions of the future life; but they are exceedingly
indefinite and shadowy. In all instances they are rather
the language of <i>desire</i>, than of hope. Platonism awakened in
the heart of humanity a consciousness of sin and a profound
feeling of want--the want of a Redeemer from sin, a spiritual,
a divine Remedy for its moral malady--and it strove after
some remedial power. But it was equally conscious of failure
and defeat. It could enlighten the reason, but it could only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="520" >520</a></span>
act imperfectly on the will. Platonic was a striking counterpart
to Pauline experience prior to the apostle's deliverance
by the power and grace of Christ. It discovered that "the
Law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and
good." It recognized that "it is spiritual, but man is carnal,
the slave of sin." It could say, "What I do I approve not;
for I do not what I would, but what I hate. But if my will
[my better judgment] is against what I do, I consent unto the
Law that it is good. And now it is no more I that do it, but
sin, that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me, that is, in
my flesh, good abideth not, for to will is present with me, but
the power to do the right is absent: the good that I would, I
do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do. I consent
gladly to the law of God in my inner man ['the rational and
immortal nature'<a id="footnotetag963" name="footnotetag963"></a>

law of sin which is in my members. <i>Oh wretched man that I

<p>This consciousness of the need of supernatural light and
help, and this aspiration after a light supernatural and divine,
which Plato inherited from Socrates, constrained him to regard
with toleration, and even reverence, every apparent approach,
every pretension, even, to a divine inspiration and guidance
in the age in which he lived. "'The greatest blessings which
men receive come through the operation of <i>phrensy</i> (µανία--inspired
exaltation), when phrensy is the gift of God. The
prophetess of Delphi, and the priestess of Dodona, many are
the benefits which in their phrensies (moments of inspiration)
they have bestowed upon Greece; but in their hours of self-possession,
few or none. And too long were it to speak of
the Sibyl, and others, who, inspired and prophetic, have delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="521">521</a></span>
utterances beneficial to the hearers. Indeed, this word
phrenetic or maniac is no reproach; it is identical with mantic
--prophetic.<a id="footnotetag966" name="footnotetag966"></a>
<a href="#footnote966"><sup class="sml">966</sup></a> And often when diseases and plagues have
fallen upon men for the sins of their forefathers, some phrensy
too has broken forth, and in prophetic strain has pointed out
a remedy, <i>showing how the sin might be expiated, and the gods
appeased</i> (by prayers, and purifications, and atoning rites)....
So many and yet more great effects could I tell you of the
phrensy which comes from the gods."<a id="footnotetag967" name="footnotetag967"></a>
<a href="#footnote967"><sup class="sml">967</sup></a> Some have discerned
in all this merely the food for a feeble ridicule. They regard
these sentiments as simply an evidence of the power and prevalence
of superstition clouding the loftiest intellects in ancient
times. By the more thoughtful and philosophic mind, however,
they will be accepted as an indication of the imperishable
and universal faith of humanity in a supernatural and supersensuous
world, and in the possibility of some communication
between heaven and earth.<a id="footnotetag968" name="footnotetag968"></a>
<a href="#footnote968"><sup class="sml">968</sup></a> And above all, it is a conclusive
proof that Plato believed that the knowledge of <i>salvation</i>--of
a remedy for sin, a method of expiation for sin, a means of
deliverance from the power and punishment of sin, must be
revealed from Heaven.</p>

<p>Paul, then, found, even in that focus of Paganism, the city
of Athens, religious aspirations tending towards Jesus Christ.
A true philosophic method, notwithstanding its shortcomings
and imperfections, concluded by desiring and seeking "the
Unknown God," by demanding him from all forms of worship,
from all schools of philosophy. The great work of preparation
in the heathen world consisted in the developing of the <i>desire</i>
for salvation. It proved that God is the great want of every
human soul; that there is a profound affinity between conscience
and the living God; and that Tertullian was right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="522" >522</a></span>
when he wrote the "Testimonium Animæ naturaliter Christianæ."<a id="footnotetag969" name="footnotetag969"></a>
<a href="#footnote969"><sup class="sml">969</sup></a>
And when it was sufficiently demonstrated that "the
world by philosophy knew not God (as a Redeeming God and
Saviour), then it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching
to save them that believe." This was all a dispensation of
divine providence, which was determined by, or "in, the wisdom
of God."<a id="footnotetag970" name="footnotetag970"></a>
<a href="#footnote970"><sup class="sml">970</sup></a></p>

<p>The history of the religions and philosophies of human
origin thus becomes to us a striking confirmation of the truth
of Christianity. It shows there is a wondrous harmony between
the instinctive wants and yearnings of the human heart,
as well as the necessary ideas and laws of the reason, and the
fundamental principles of revealed religion. There is "a law
written on the heart"--written by the finger of God, which
corresponds to the laws written by the same finger on "tables
of stone." There are certain necessary and immutable principles
and ideas infolded in the reason of man, which harmonize
with the revelations of the Eternal Logos in the written
word.<a id="footnotetag971" name="footnotetag971x"></a>
<a href="#footnote971"><sup class="sml">971</sup></a> There are instinctive longings, mysterious yearnings
of the human heart, to which that unveiling of the heart of
God which is made in the teaching and life of the incarnate
God most satisfyingly answers. Within the depths of the human
spirit there is an "oracle" which responds to the voice of
"the living oracles of God."</p>

<p>Here, then, are two distinct and independent revelations--the
unwritten revelation which God has made to all men in
the constitution of the human mind, and the external written
revelation which he has made in the person and teaching of
his Son. And these two are perfectly harmonious. We have
here two great volumes--the volume of conscience, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="523" >523</a></span>
volume of the New Testament. We open them, and find they
announce the <i>same</i> truths--one in dim outline, the other in a
full portraiture. There are the same fundamental principles
underlying both revelations. They both bear the impress of
<i>divinity</i>. The history of philosophy may have been marked
by many errors of interpretation; so, also, has the history of
dogmatic theology. Men may have often misunderstood and
misinterpreted the dictates of conscience; so have theologians
misunderstood and misinterpreted the dictates of revelation.
The perversions of conscience and reason have been plead
in defense of error and sin; and so, for ages, have the perversions
of Scripture been urged in defense of slavery, oppression,
falsehood, and wrong. Sometimes the misunderstood
utterances of conscience, of philosophy, and of science have
been arrayed against the incorrect interpretations of the Word
of God. But when both are better understood, and more
justly conceived, they are found in wondrous harmony. When
the New Testament speaks to man of God, of duty, of immortality,
and of retribution, man feels that its teachings "commend
themselves to his conscience" and reason. When it
speaks to him of redemption, of salvation, of eternal life and
blessedness, he feels that it meets and answers all the wants
and longings of his heart. Thus does Christianity throw light
upon the original revelations of God in the human conscience,
and answers all the yearnings of the human soul. So it is
found in individual experiences, so it has been found in the
history of humanity. As Leverrier and Adams were enabled
to affirm, from purely mathematical reasoning, that another
planet must exist beyond <i>Uranus</i> which had never yet been
seen by human eyes, and then, afterwards, that affirmation was
gloriously verified in the discovery of <i>Neptune</i> by the telescope
of Galle; so the reasonings of ancient philosophy, based on
certain necessary laws of mind, enabled man to affirm the existence
of a God, of the soul, of a future retribution, and an
eternal life beyond the grave; and, then, subsequently, these
were brought fully into light, and verified by the Gospel.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="524">524</a></span>

<p>We conclude in the words of Pressensé: "To isolate it from
the past, would be to refuse to comprehend the nature of Christianity
itself, and the extent of its triumphs. Although the
Gospel is not, as has been affirmed, the product of anterior civilizations--a
mere compound of Greek and Oriental elements--it
is not the less certain that it brings to the human mind
the satisfaction vainly sought by it in the East as in the West.
<i>Omnia subito</i> is not its device, but that of the Gnostic heresy.
Better to say, with Clement of Alexandria and Origen, that the
night of paganism had its stars to light it, but that they called
to the Morning-star which stood over Bethlehem."</p>

<p>"If we regard philosophy as a preparation for Christianity,
instead of seeking in it a substitute for the Gospel, we shall not
need to overstate its grandeur in order to estimate its real
value."</p>
